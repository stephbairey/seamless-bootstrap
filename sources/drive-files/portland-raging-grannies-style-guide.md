# Portland Raging Grannies Newsletter Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles

**Voice:** Warm, intelligent, and conversational. We speak to each other as equals who care deeply about justice work.

**Tone:** Direct without being preachy. Respectful without being overly formal. We assume our readers are engaged, thoughtful people who can handle complex topics.

**Length:** Concise but complete. Give enough context that someone can understand and decide if they want to engage further, but don't overwhelm.

## Editorial Workflow

### Source Content

Newsletter items are collected throughout the week from emails labeled PRG/Newsletter in Gmail. Content arrives through several channels:

- Items sent directly to `grannynewsletter@gaggle.email` or `grannynewsletter@gmail.com`
- Items sent to Steph personally at `stephbairey@gmail.com` or `pdxraginggrannies@gmail.com`
- Items forwarded from team distribution lists (enviro, gender equity, RIJ, etc.)
- Items sent to the full `prg-members` list that Steph flags for the newsletter

Some emails arrive as multipart/related (usually containing embedded images) and their body text may not parse through the Gmail API. In those cases, work from the snippet preview and ask Steph for the full content if needed.

When team notes or other content arrive as attachments rather than inline text, Steph will host the file (usually as a PDF on the PRG website) and provide a link. See "Team Notes as Attachments" below for the treatment.

### Ordering Items

Items are ordered by priority, following this general framework:

1. **Meeting reminders / calls for agenda items** — When a monthly meeting is imminent (within the next few days), this goes in the first slot.
2. **Major organizational news** — Team name changes, leadership transitions, structural announcements. Things every granny needs to know.
3. **Time-sensitive actions** — Events happening tomorrow or this week. Rallies, hearings, deadlines.
4. **Upcoming actions and events** — Things happening in the next few weeks that require sign-ups or planning.
5. **Team meeting notes** — What the teams have been discussing and deciding.
6. **Community events and performances** — Granny-adjacent events, shows grannies are in, etc.
7. **Nice-to-know content** — Articles, videos, resources, inspirational shares.
8. **Compiled items from high-volume contributors** — Always last. See "Handling High-Volume Contributors" below.

Use judgment within these tiers. If two items are both "upcoming actions," put the sooner one first.

### Stale and Expired Content

- **Events that already happened:** Drop them entirely. If someone sends a rally announcement and the rally was yesterday, it doesn't go in the newsletter.
- **Expired deadlines with ongoing issues:** Use judgment. If a testimony deadline passed but the legislative fight continues with future action points, keep it if there's something actionable (a future hearing, a press conference, an ongoing comment period). Drop it if there's nothing for grannies to do right now.
- **General rule:** If a granny reading the newsletter can't do anything with the information, it probably doesn't belong.

### Agenda vs. Newsletter Separation

Sometimes contributors send agenda items and newsletter items in the same email. Separate them. Agenda content gets built independently by Steph; only the newsletter-relevant pieces go into the newsletter. If someone sends a meeting agenda for Saturday's meeting, don't include the agenda itself — but do include related announcements (like a raffle or a call for agenda items from other grannies).

### Duplicate and Overlapping Submissions

When multiple people send the same item (e.g., two grannies both forward information about the same event), pick one attribution and skip the other. Generally favor:

- The person who sent it specifically for the newsletter over someone who forwarded it as part of a batch
- The person with a direct connection to the event (organizer, participant) over someone sharing it secondhand
- The earlier submission if all else is equal

## Item Types & Approaches

### Meeting Notes (Inline)

**Keep them as-is.** Meeting notes should preserve:
- Original formatting and structure
- Conversational tone from the meeting
- All practical details (who attended, decisions made, action items)
- Numbered lists if that's how they were sent
- Names and specifics

**Don't:** Clean them up to sound more "professional" or formal. The informal tone reflects PRG's collaborative culture.

**Example approach:** If someone sends meeting notes, format them exactly as written unless there are obvious typos or formatting issues. Use bold `<strong>` subtitles for each agenda topic to make them scannable.

### Team Notes as Attachments

When team meeting notes arrive as file attachments rather than inline email text, use a short treatment:

**Title:** "Meeting Notes from the [Team Name] Team"

**Body:** A brief one-sentence teaser like "Catch up with what the [Team Name] team discussed at their latest meeting" or "Read what the [Team Name] team is up to."

**Link:** A `» Read the meeting notes` link to the hosted PDF.

**Example:**
```
Title: Meeting Notes from the Racial and Immigration Justice Team
From: Karen Fletcher

Catch up with what the Racial and Immigration Justice team discussed at their latest meeting.

» Read the meeting notes
```

Common team abbreviations to spell out:
- RIJ = Racial and Immigration Justice (or Racial & Immigration Justice)
- GAGH = Grannies Against Gun Harm

### Article Summaries

When summarizing external articles or content:

**First paragraph:** Establish context
- Who wrote/created it
- What it's about
- Why it exists (vigil, protest song, essay, etc.)

**Second paragraph:** Core content
- Pull 1-2 compelling quotes that capture the piece
- Choose quotes that are specific, visceral, or actionable
- Avoid generic "this is important" statements

**Third paragraph (if needed):** Why it matters
- Connect to grannies' values or current work
- Offer a takeaway or reflection
- Keep it brief

**Example:**
```
Organizer and writer Kelly Hayes delivered these remarks at a vigil for Renee
Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother shot and killed by an ICE agent in
Minneapolis. Over 200 people gathered in Chicago's Winnemac Park to grieve,
resist, and refuse to be terrorized into abandoning their neighbors.

Hayes speaks to the cost of remaining human in inhuman times - feeling grief
when our enemies would have us harden, choosing solidarity when they demand
fear, and refusing to normalize state violence by simply asking for
better-trained agents of repression. "We are not here to ask for a gentler
boot on our neighbors' necks," she says. "We are here to say no - no to
the kidnapping of our neighbors, no to the normalization of fascist violence."

This is a powerful reminder of why we show up, why we grieve together, and
why we will not scatter in fear.
```

### Action Items & Announcements

**Lead with the essential facts:**
- What's happening
- When and where
- What people need to know or bring

**Follow with details:**
- Practical instructions
- Context if needed
- Contact information

**Keep it scannable:** If there are multiple pieces of information (what to wear, what to bring, multiple dates), use line breaks to separate them clearly.

**Official vs. individual actions:** When an event is not an official PRG action (i.e., the gaggle hasn't formally agreed to participate), note that clearly: "This is not an official PRG action, but grannies are welcome to attend individually." This matters for how grannies understand their participation.

**Example pattern:**
```
[Event name] is [when]. [Essential detail].

What to wear: [details]
What to bring: [details]
Location: [address]

This is not an official PRG action, but grannies are welcome to attend
individually.
```

### Personal Shares & Reflections

**Preserve the writer's voice.** When someone shares something personal (like Connie's farewell or Sulima's party invitation), keep their exact words and phrasing.

**Don't:** Rewrite to sound more uniform or professional. These items work because they're genuine.

### Compiled Items (Rollup Format)

When a single contributor has multiple nice-to-know items that don't each warrant their own newsletter entry, compile them into a single item. See "Handling High-Volume Contributors" for the editorial framework.

**Structure:**
- **Title:** "From [Name]: [Descriptive Category]" (e.g., "From Joana Kirchhoff: Environmental Action Links")
- **Intro:** One sentence framing the collection (no "From:" attribution line since the name is in the title)
- **Sub-items:** Each gets a bold subtitle, one descriptive sentence, and one `»` link
- **Spacing:** Double `<br/>` between sub-items

**Example:**
```html
<p class="title" ...>From Joana Kirchhoff: Environmental Action Links</p>
<p class="body" ...>Joana shares the following resources and action items for
grannies interested in environmental issues.
  <br/>
  <br/><strong>CEI Hub Press Conference - March 31</strong>
  <br/>The CEI Hub Taskforce is holding a press conference about the Critical
  Energy Infrastructure Hub.
  <br/><a href="URL">&raquo; View the flyer</a>
  <br/>
  <br/><strong>BARK: Intro to NEPA - February 26</strong>
  <br/>BARK is hosting an introduction to the National Environmental Policy Act.
  <br/><a href="URL">&raquo; Register for the event</a>
</p>
```

**This item always goes last in the newsletter.**

### Handling High-Volume Contributors

Some contributors (notably Joana Kirchhoff, Environment Team lead) forward a large volume of content. Not everything warrants its own newsletter item. Use this framework:

**Full item (own entry):** The content describes something PRG is specifically doing as a group, has been invited to do, or where members need to make a decision. Examples: "PRG has been invited to sing at X," "We need grannies to carpool to Salem for advocacy day," "The team voted to support this action."

**Compiled into the rollup:** The content is nice-to-know - a petition, an article, an event she's sharing as FYI, a forwarded action alert from another organization. These are things an individual granny might choose to engage with, but PRG isn't taking group action on them.

**Drop entirely:** The event has already passed, the deadline is expired with no ongoing action, or the content is a duplicate of something already covered.

When the compiled item's sub-items are all environmental, title it "Environmental Action Links." If the topics span broader areas, use something like "Action Links & Resources."

The top sub-item in the compiled section should be the most significant or team-relevant item (e.g., Enviro Team meeting notes go first).

## Quote Selection

**Choose quotes that:**
- Contain specific imagery or ideas (not generic praise)
- Give a sense of the writer's voice
- Capture the core argument or emotion
- Are self-contained enough to understand out of context

**Avoid quotes that:**
- Require extensive setup to understand
- Are too abstract or general
- Are longer than 2-3 sentences

## Language Choices

**Political language:** Use the language the grannies use. Don't soften or euphemize. If the original source says "fascist violence," say "fascist violence."

**Acronyms:** Spell out on first use if it's not obvious (ICE is fine, but spell out PIRC as Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition).

**Names:** Always use full names on first mention.

**Places:** Include full addresses when relevant for events.

**Headlines:** Use title case for all item headlines.

## What to Include vs. Omit

**Always include:**
- Context for why something matters
- Practical information (dates, times, locations)
- Contact information when provided
- Calls to action

**Can omit:**
- Excessive background that most grannies will already know
- Redundant information
- Tangential details that don't serve the main point
- Gaggle.email footer boilerplate (reply/unsubscribe links)
- Email signature blocks and quotes (e.g., Joana's John Lewis quote)

**Never omit:**
- Safety information
- Attribution
- Critical dates or deadlines
- Important caveats (like "do not share on social media")

## Handling Difficult Content

When summarizing content about violence, trauma, or injustice:

**Be clear and direct.** Don't minimize or obscure what happened.

**Be respectful.** Name victims and honor their humanity.

**Connect to action.** When appropriate, connect grief and outrage to what grannies can do.

**Example:** The Kelly Hayes piece doesn't shy away from the violence but connects it directly to resistance and solidarity.

## Common Patterns

### Event Invitations
Format: What/When/Where/Why come/What to bring or know

### Video or Article Shares
Format: Brief description of content - Why it's worth watching/reading - Key takeaway or quote - Link

### Meeting Notes
Format: Meeting info (date, attendees) - Agenda items in order - Action items clearly marked

### Personal Announcements
Format: Preserve sender's voice and structure exactly

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Too generic:** If your summary could apply to any article about the same topic, you haven't captured what makes this piece specific.

**Too long:** If the summary is more than 2-3 short paragraphs, it's probably too detailed.

**Too sanitized:** If you've removed all the edge or emotion from content that was passionate or angry, you've lost the voice.

**Missing context:** If someone reading this wouldn't understand why it's in the newsletter, add a connecting sentence.

## Final Check Questions

Before finalizing an item, ask:
- Does this sound like how grannies talk to each other?
- Is the essential information easy to find?
- Have I preserved the voice of the original source?
- Would this motivate someone to click through/show up/take action?
- Is anything unclear or confusing?

## Remember

The newsletter serves grannies who are busy, engaged, and intelligent. Respect their time, respect their intelligence, and give them what they need to stay connected and take action.

# HTML Format

## Container Structure

Every newsletter item uses this exact container:
```html
<div class="items" style="max-width: 650px;margin: 20px auto;background: #ffffff;border-radius: 6px;box-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, .15);padding: 0 40px 40px 40px;">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
```

## Headline/Title
```html
<p class="title" style="font-size:20px;font-weight:700;color:#d6616c;margin:30px 0 6px 0;mso-margin-top-alt:30px;border-top:3px solid #d6616c;padding: 27px 0 27px 0;">Headline Here</p>
```

## Body Text
```html
<p class="body" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:400;line-height:1.55;margin:0 0 6px 0;">
  <!-- Body content here -->
</p>
```

### Attribution Line

**Format:** `From: [Name]`

- Always starts with "From: "
- Followed by first and last name
- Followed by `<br/><br/>` before content begins
- For compiled/rollup items where the contributor's name is in the title, omit the "From:" line

**Example:**
```html
From: Karen Fletcher
<br/>
<br/>Content starts here...
```

### Paragraph Breaks

**Use:** `<br/><br/>` between paragraphs

**CRITICAL:** HTML is not forgiving. Each `<br/>` must be exact with no spaces inside the tag.

**Example:**
```html
First paragraph.
<br/>
<br/>Second paragraph.
<br/>
<br/>Third paragraph.
```

### Single Line Breaks

**Use:** `<br/>` for single line breaks (within lists, addresses, etc.)

**Example:**
```html
Meeting location:
<br/>1234 Main Street
<br/>Portland, OR 97214
```

## Links

### Link Text Style

**Prefer contextual, descriptive link text over generic text or bare URLs.** The link text should tell the reader what they'll get when they click.

**Good:**
- `» Get tickets on Eventbrite`
- `» Sign up on Rallly`
- `» Read the meeting notes`
- `» View the flyer`
- `» Watch the dance video`
- `» Read on Substack`
- `» Register for the event`

**Avoid:**
- `» Read more` (when you can be more specific)
- `» Click here`
- Bare URLs as visible text

`» Read more` is acceptable as a fallback when there's no more specific description, but always try for something better first.

### Read More Links

These go at the bottom of the entry.

```html
<a href="URL_HERE">&raquo; Contextual link text</a>
```

**Variations:**
- `&raquo; Watch` for videos
- `&raquo; Listen` for audio
- Always preceded by `<br/><br/>`

### Email Links (mailto)
```html
<a href="mailto:email@domain.com">email@domain.com</a>
```
or
```html
<a href="mailto:email@domain.com">Name</a>
```

## Text Formatting

### Bold Text

**Use:** `<strong>` tags (not `<b>`)

**Example:**
```html
<strong>Want something in the newsletter? Send it to:</strong>
```

**When to use:**
- Section headers within body copy (e.g., agenda topics in meeting notes)
- Emphasis on key information (dates, locations)
- Instructions or calls to action
- Subtitles in compiled/rollup items

### Underscores for Emphasis

When source text contains `__text__`, convert to <em> HTML:
```html
As always, <em>your presence and the light you bring are gift enough.</em>
```

## Special Characters

**Use HTML entities:**
- `&raquo;` for » (right double angle quotation mark)
- `&hellip;` for ... (ellipsis)
- `&amp;` for & (ampersand)
- Replace double hyphens with single dash: `--` becomes `-`
- No em dashes at any time!

## Table of Contents Format
```html
<li style="list-style:disc;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;margin:0 0 8px 0;">Headline Here</li>
```

**Rules:**
- Must match exact headline text from items below
- Must appear in same order as items in newsletter body
- No line breaks within `<li>` tags

## Complete Example
```html
<div class="items" style="max-width: 650px;margin: 20px auto;background: #ffffff;border-radius: 6px;box-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, .15);padding: 0 40px 40px 40px;">
  <p class="title" style="font-size:20px;font-weight:700;color:#d6616c;margin:30px 0 6px 0;mso-margin-top-alt:30px;border-top:3px solid #d6616c;padding: 27px 0 27px 0;">Example Item Title</p>
  <p class="body" style="font-size:14px;font-weight:400;line-height:1.55;margin:0 0 6px 0;">From: Jane Granny
    <br/>
    <br/>First paragraph of content goes here. It can be as long as needed.
    <br/>
    <br/>Second paragraph here.
    <br/>
    <br/>More content if needed.
    <br/>
    <br/><a href="https://example.com">&raquo; Read more about this topic</a>
  </p>
</div>
```

## Common Patterns

### Lists Within Body Text

**Email lists with descriptions:**
```html
<a href="mailto:prg-enviro-team@gaggle.email">prg-enviro-team@gaggle.email</a> - Environment
<br/><a href="mailto:prg-gender-team@gaggle.email">prg-gender-team@gaggle.email</a> - Gender Equity
```

**Bulleted lists (use HTML):**
```html
<ul>
<li>Item one</li>
<li>Item two</li>
<li>Item three</li>
</ul>
```

### Meeting Information
```html
Meeting: Wednesday, January 15, 2026
<br/>Time: 5:00 PM via Zoom
<br/>In attendance: Name1, Name2, Name3
```

### Addresses
```html
Location: Building Name
<br/>1234 Street Address
<br/>City, State ZIP
```

## Quality Control Checklist

Before sending, verify:
- [ ] All `<br/>` tags are properly closed (no spaces)
- [ ] Headlines match exactly between ToC and items
- [ ] Items appear in same order as ToC
- [ ] All email addresses are wrapped in mailto links
- [ ] "From: " line is present for all attributed items (except compiled items)
- [ ] Paragraph breaks use `<br/><br/>`
- [ ] Links use `&raquo;` with contextual text, not bare URLs
- [ ] No double hyphens (`--`) in copy (use single `-`)
- [ ] No em dashes
- [ ] Container div and paragraph tags are exact matches to template
- [ ] Headlines are in title case
- [ ] Stale/expired items have been removed
- [ ] Ampersands use `&amp;` in HTML

## Notes

**HTML is unforgiving:** Every tag, every character must be exact. Missing closing tags, extra spaces in tags, or malformed syntax will break the formatting.

**Consistency matters:** Using the exact same styling for every item ensures the newsletter renders properly across all email clients.
