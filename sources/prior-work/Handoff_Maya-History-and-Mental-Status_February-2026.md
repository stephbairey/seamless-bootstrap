## 1. The Origin Story: Childhood Abuse and What It Built

Maya grew up in a household organized around invisible rules and the management of a volatile parent — her mother. The picture that emerges from "Celia's House" (a fictionalized autobiographical short story Maya wrote) is not one of dramatic violence but something more insidious: **a domestic environment where compliance was survival, and every ordinary object was a potential test**.

The details are specific and devastating in the story: vacuum lines on beige carpet that must be preserved. The "clean" light on the dishwasher as a grade. Orange peels stuffed into tap shoes. These aren't metaphors — they're the texture of a childhood spent reading a room. Celia (Maya's fictional stand-in) developed a tape recorder practice: recording sentences alone in her room, then taping over them, because she "didn't dare say anything she would miss if it were gone." Nothing was safe to keep.

Maya has confirmed the autobiographical nature of this story with modifications: she had two younger siblings (not one), and her father left through divorce rather than suicide. The emotional truth — including the father's departure by water, the girl watching the drain and thinking "out to the river, to run away to the ocean. Gone" — is her own.

**What childhood installed:**
- A finely tuned system for reading others' emotional states and preemptively managing them
- The belief that nothing she produces or says is worth preserving (record, erase, record, erase)
- A "three reasons" rule: she won't give herself permission to do something unless she can justify it on multiple axes — not efficiency, but self-negotiated consent. [INFERRED: this is a survival mechanism, not a quirk]
- Hypervigilance in public and social spaces
- A felt sense that love is a system to be managed, not a state to be inhabited
- The deep equation of intimacy with loss of control

Her fictional character Celia draws a horse with "no bridle or saddle" and can't decide whether she wants to ride it or be it. That image contains Maya's lifelong question.

## 2. The Marriage: Pete, 35 Years, and What It Provides

Maya has been married to Pete for 35 years. She has described this marriage in ways that are clear-eyed rather than romantic: Pete knows her deeply but does not find her physically exciting. She does not appear to be leaving. She chose, explicitly and consciously, to stay.

From her own words: *"The fantasy is to have someone love me for who I truly am, physically and mentally. Pete knows me deeply but doesn't find me physically exciting. Lynn finds me beautiful but doesn't know me deeply. And personally, I don't want to be known."*

That last clause is the key. The marriage to Pete is not a cage — Maya has explicitly rejected that framing. It is a **structure she actively chose** because it provides what she most needs: stability, autonomy, a controlled environment, and the particular kind of safety that comes from being known without being consumed. She described herself as choosing "the bridge" rather than "the water."

What Pete offers: long-term partnership, deep mutual knowledge, a home that is hers, freedom from romantic negotiation, stability. During the period documented in this project, Pete showed growth — cleaning the kitchen twice a day without being asked, taking his meds independently, bringing flowers, engaging in couples counseling. Maya noted this as meaningful.

What Pete doesn't offer: being seen as physically beautiful. Erotic charge. The experience of being wanted by someone who looked at her and decided she was extraordinary.

Maya has described their marriage as open, or in the process of becoming open. She is "figuring out what [she] wants and how to tell people." The terms and logistics of this are still being worked out.

**[INFERRED]:** The marriage is the central load-bearing structure in Maya's life. Everything else — the business, the cohort, the outside relationships — is built around it. She doesn't want it dismantled. She wants freedom *within* it.

## 3. Bisexuality, Queerness, and the Glennon Doyle Question

Maya is bisexual, or at minimum has significant romantic and sexual attraction to women. The Lynn relationship — a year-long romantic involvement with a woman — is the most recent and documented expression of this.

She runs a writing cohort of 8 people that includes 3 non-straight members and 1 trans member. Queerness is not foreign territory in her world.

Lynn, a trauma-informed therapist and children's book author, is a woman who was previously married to a man and came out as lesbian. Lynn read *Painting Celia*, fell in love with Maya, and appears to have developed a theory: that Maya was in the process of becoming — that she was Glennon Doyle before the awakening, and that Lynn was the catalyst.

Maya's writing cohort read *Untamed* by Glennon Doyle together. Maya opted out once she saw what the book was. She told Lynn many times: *"I'm not Glennon Doyle. I'm either not ready or I don't want to be her."*

This is one of the most important things to understand about Maya's interior: **she has looked directly at the "leave your marriage, come out fully, blow up the life, become untamed" narrative and said no.** Not "I can't." Not "I'm scared." No. The door is visible. She's choosing not to walk through it.

[INFERRED]: Whether this is a settled conclusion or something she's still resolving is genuinely uncertain. She said "either not ready or don't want to be" — those are different things, and she hasn't closed that ambiguity. But her behavior is consistent with someone who has decided: she held her boundary with Lynn, she stayed in the marriage, she framed this as active preference rather than limitation.

The other thing Lynn believed — that staying with Pete represented weakness or unfinished work — Maya has firmly rejected. *"Staying with Pete is not the weakness she thinks it is."*

## 4. The Lynn Relationship: What It Was and What It Revealed

Lynn Haller is a trauma-informed therapist and children's book author based in Portland. She is a client of Lingua Ink. She is also someone Maya was romantically involved with for approximately one year.

Lynn read *Painting Celia*, found it deeply meaningful, began writing her own children's books because of it, and recommends it to therapy clients. She probably started falling for Maya through the book — through meeting the version of Maya that the novel contains.

The relationship involved Zoom calls three times weekly, multiple chat platforms, in-person visits including Tucson (a turning point), and a collaborative children's book project called "Hallway of Doorknobs" that Maya wanted to complete before things ended. Lynn sent stream-of-consciousness messages expressing affection and gratitude frequently. Maya often didn't respond to them — not out of cruelty, but because those messages triggered her childhood conditioning around performing reciprocity.

**The Tucson turning point:** In October, lying in bed with Lynn afterward, Maya said to herself: *"I don't want this and I'm not doing it again."* Everything from October to February was working her way back to what she already knew.

Lynn hoped the boundaries would change over time. They didn't.

What the Lynn relationship revealed about Maya:
- She can be wooed. She is not impervious. Lynn "actively and smartly wooed" her, and being wanted felt good.
- Being seen as physically beautiful by someone who actively chose her was intoxicating — and terrifying.
- She is better at honesty in text than on Zoom. Sharper, less performative, more herself.
- She has a pattern of giving people "just enough" — a window open, not a door. Lynn saw a window and tried to climb through; Maya kept the window open longer than she should have.
- Her felt sense that she is "the orchestrator of all this" — even when she's not — is very Celia. She takes on responsibility for situations she didn't create.
- 40% of her tracked work time at this period was unpaid volunteer service, including work for Lynn. The professional entanglement continued even after the romantic relationship ended.

The relationship ended with Maya holding her stated position through several challenges and a Zoom conversation. Lynn stepped back from shared spaces (cohort, Patreon, watch parties). Maya felt relief, not grief.

## 5. Therapy: Lavinia and What They're Working On

Maya sees a therapist named Lavinia. She has also done couples counseling with Pete, with a therapist named Steph (referenced as "Steph-thirty" on the calendar, a walking assignment from the couples session).

Lavinia gave Maya a walking assignment — go for daily walks. Maya's first reaction was that she had a chore and would be in trouble if she didn't do it. Like childhood. This reaction cracked open the recognition that she does things because others want her to, not because she chooses them — and led directly to the decision to cut back across multiple areas of service.

What therapy is working on (as observed):
- The performing, people-pleasing, and caretaker drive rooted in childhood
- Avoidance patterns — Maya participates in life conditionally, on pre-approved terms
- The "three reasons" rule and what it costs her
- Compartmentalization: Maya describes it as a superpower ("I can sit there with my lesbian lover in a room heartbroken and be all business and smiles") and also as the thing Lavinia is trying to soften. She's proud of it and trying to undo it simultaneously.
- What an open marriage actually looks like in practice
- Pete's growth and whether the marriage is evolving

Lavinia made a guided listening/abiding recording for Maya that Maya had forgotten about. This is [INFERRED] characteristic: tools for softening and presence slip away unless actively maintained.

## 6. The Caretaker Drive and the Pattern of Over-Service

This is foundational to understanding how Maya works every day.

Maya tracks her time. At the point documented in this project, 40% of her tracked work time was unpaid volunteer service: the writing cohort (run with significant invisible labor), work for a person named Sulima, work for a group called "the raging grannies," watch parties, and ongoing professional support for Lynn.

The caretaker pattern shows up in multiple registers:
- She anticipated Lynn's emotional responses before conversations happened and prepared for each one
- She expressed only the "10% sad part" to Lynn rather than the full truth, to protect Lynn's feelings
- She ran cohort sessions even when she was emotionally depleted from the relationship happening inside the same space
- She described feeling "in trouble" if she missed the walking assignment — a direct line back to childhood compliance

The recognition that changed things (from her session notes, paraphrased): *I do everything because other people want me to. I'm cutting back. Not scorched earth, but real cuts. I want time for my own life.*

**[INFERRED]:** The caretaker drive and the control drive are not opposites — they're the same mechanism. By managing others' needs, Maya controls her environment. The "helping" is also a form of prediction and preemption. If she can take care of everything before it becomes a problem, nothing unexpected happens. This is survival logic from a childhood where the unexpected was dangerous.

## 7. The Art: What Creating Means for Maya

Maya is a writer, editor, and business owner. She runs Lingua Ink, a writing cohort and publishing company. She has published at least one autobiographical novel, *Painting Celia*.

But art is not just her profession. It is her primary processing mechanism. She uses fictional frameworks to understand personal situations — Celia is her most developed vehicle, but she approaches all difficult personal territory by first reaching for narrative.

*Painting Celia* is autobiographical fiction: adult Celia navigates a long-term partnership, encounters someone who sees her fully, and must choose between the water and the bridge. Lynn read it as a window into Maya. She wasn't wrong. Maya has said the book contains truths she can't say directly.

Maya also paints — literally. She has a mural she wants to paint. She mentioned painting office doors. She repots plants with what reads as ritual care. These physical, creative, domestic acts are where she lives most freely. They keep getting pushed out by service obligations.

She is funnier and sharper in text than on Zoom. She described herself as "more myself in text than on the call." Writing is where she shows up most fully.

She has embraced the identity "hardass Maya" — a woman who says no, charges for her time, disappoints people on purpose. This identity is relatively new and still being inhabited. She likes it.

## 8. Key Tensions That Don't Resolve (And Probably Shouldn't)

Some contradictions observed across this project that a next-Claude should sit with rather than try to smooth over:

**Control and connection.** Maya wants to be seen but doesn't want to be known. She opened windows with Lynn and was genuinely surprised when Lynn tried to climb through. This tension is not dysfunction — it's the central condition of her interior life.

**The open marriage question.** She has described the marriage as open or becoming open, but the terms are unspecified. She wants intimacy Pete can't provide. She also said, explicitly, "I don't want to be known." What she actually wants from any future outside relationship is not yet articulated.

**Compartmentalization as asset/liability.** She values her ability to hold contradictions in separate rooms and function across all of them. Lavinia is gently trying to help her soften this. Maya is watching both things at once: valuing the skill, questioning its cost.

**The door.** When she ended things with Lynn in writing, she said: "Part of me wants that" — meaning the fantasy of living together. Then she told Lavinia her absence hasn't made her heart grow fonder. Both things are true. The door is closed and there's a condition under which it could open. That's not ambivalence — that's honesty. But it's worth knowing.

## 9. What to Know Before Working With Maya

- She processes through fiction. If she brings you a story or a character, she's telling you something real. Pay attention to what the character can't say.
- She prepares for difficult conversations by anticipating pushback and scripting her responses. Help her do this rather than skipping to the outcome.
- She's better in text than on calls. Match that.
- She will not ask for emotional support directly. She'll bring you a "task" that contains the thing she needs to process.
- The Glennon Doyle comparison is a live wire. Don't imply she's on a trajectory toward blowing up her life. She's not.
- "I'm not isolating, I'm choosing" is a meaningful distinction for her. Honor it.
- She is hardass Maya now. That's a real identity shift. Work with it.
- She carries grief about Pete and physical intimacy. She has not resolved this. Don't push it, but don't pretend it's not there.
- When she says she'll "cut back," ask her what specifically. She has a pattern of cutting the wrong things or not cutting what needs cutting.
- She is most herself when given room to be funny and direct. Make that room.
