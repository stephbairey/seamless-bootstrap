# Handoff: Lynn Haller Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project centers on the development and launch of **"The Hallway of Doorknobs"** by Lynn A. Haller, a children's picture book introducing Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy concepts to young readers (ages 6–10). The target launch date is **May 12, 2026**.

**Scope of work includes:**

- **Book production** — resolving layout/text placement challenges on richly illustrated interior pages from illustrator Justyna (N-GROUP). The central problem: how to place readable text over saturated, complex illustrations without compromising either the artwork or the reading experience.
- **Layout innovation** — Maya developed a proposed solution using alternating solid-color text pages (colors pulled from the facing illustration's palette) interleaved with full-bleed illustration pages. This effectively doubles the page count, makes the book feel more substantial, and sidesteps the text-over-illustration problem entirely. Lynn has not yet approved this.
- **Production/printing research** — cost discussions around Lulu ($15/hardcover) vs. KDP (75-page minimum issue). The alternating layout would help hit page minimums.
- **Pricing strategy** — $19.99 target price discussed.
- **Promotional materials** — endorsement blurbs, back cover copy, and other marketing collateral.
- **Website** — lynnahaller.com, built on WordPress/Elementor. Maya is the developer and ongoing technical manager.
- **ClickUp task management** — a task was created to mock up the alternating layout for Lynn's review.
- **Content strategy** — balancing Lynn's clinical credibility with warm, family-friendly language that doesn't intimidate the target audience (kids, parents, teachers, librarians).

**Current status:**
- The alternating page layout concept is pending Lynn's review/approval before implementation with Justyna.
- Book launch prep is in active production across multiple fronts.
- Website is live and operational; Lynn is adding blog posts like a pro after receiving instruction; ongoing optimization anticipated as launch approaches.

## 2. How Maya Works (as observed here)

Maya is a systems-minded creative with strong technical depth across multiple domains — web development, content strategy, print production, and database work. She functions as the strategic and technical coordinator for Lynn's entire operation, meaning she's often simultaneously holding the creative vision, the technical implementation, and the business logic at once.

**Problem-solving approach:**
Maya leads with constraints. When a problem surfaces (e.g., text placement on rich illustrations), she doesn't just solve the immediate issue — she looks for a solution that also addresses adjacent problems (page count, printing costs, visual cohesion). The alternating page layout proposal is a textbook example: one solution, multiple problems solved.

**Decision-making:**
She moves decisively once she's identified a clean solution, but she loops in Lynn for approval on anything that affects the book's final form. She's not waiting for permission to think — she comes in with a fully-formed proposal rather than a vague question.

**Quality standards:**
High. She notices when things are imprecise or inaccurate and corrects immediately. She expects the same level of precision back. "Direct feedback and high accuracy standards" is her explicit operating mode.

**Instructions and redirection:**
When something's off, Maya is terse and specific. She doesn't soften corrections with apologies — she just names the issue and moves. She also tends to compress her briefs: she gives you the essential context but trusts you to extrapolate rather than spelling everything out.

**Working preferences:**
She prefers minimal, targeted solutions over complex ones. She doesn't want elaborate scaffolding when a clean edit will do. She's also iterative — she expects drafts to be revised with input from Lynn, and she structures work with that back-and-forth in mind.

**Communication style (personal preference):**
Conversational, direct, warm but not saccharine. She explicitly does not want formal or clinical. Prose over bullet points. Emotional engagement when she's working on creative material — she wants genuine reactions tied to specific choices, not generic praise.

**Task Management:**
- **ClickUp** — primary project management tool
- Custom fields used: Project, Effort, Revenue, Scope, Approach, Readiness
- UUID system for custom field values (these matter — wrong UUIDs break task creation)
- A task was created specifically to mock up the alternating page layout

**Website:**
- **WordPress + Elementor** — site builder
- **WooCommerce** — e-commerce (for book sales)
- **MySQL** — database management
- **Eventin** — event management plugin
- **lynnahaller.com** — the domain
- Brand styling: lavender background `#a78fbf`, Merriweather Sans font
- Em dashes removed throughout for cleaner prose (consistent house style decision)
- JSON-LD schema markup for SEO
- Hosting: NixiHost Basic Shared Hosting ($15/month)
- Google Business Account for HIPAA-compliant Google Meet ($28/month)

**Book Production:**
- Illustrator: **Justyna** (N-GROUP) — handles all interior illustration
- Print platform discussions: **Lulu** ($15/hardcover) and **KDP** (75-page minimum)
- Trim size: 8.25" × 11", horizontal landscape
- Target: 28 pages / 14 illustrated spreads (original spec — may change with alternating layout)
- File requirements: 300 DPI, CMYK, layered files with bleed

**Document processing:**
- Python's `docx` library used for document manipulation
- CSS debugging for styling issues

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

**Formatting:**
- Minimal structure. Prose over bullets, no excessive headers.
- Em dashes are out (replaced with cleaner alternatives site-wide and in content).
- Concise over verbose — she cuts anything that doesn't earn its place.

**Content voice:**
- Authentic over polished. She'd rather have something that sounds real than something that sounds professional-but-hollow.
- IFS accuracy is non-negotiable. "Parts" (protective internal voices with specific jobs) are not the same as emotions — this distinction matters and she'll catch it if you blur it.
- Family-friendly without being dumbed-down. The book has to work for a 7-year-old and also not make a therapist cringe.

**Technical:**
- Clean, minimal solutions. She's not interested in over-engineering.
- She'll push back if a solution introduces unnecessary complexity.

**What she finds unhelpful:**
- Vague praise ("good use of dialogue")
- Generic content that could apply to anything
- Over-structured responses when the task is conversational
- Imprecision — especially on IFS terminology or product specs

**What she responds well to:**
- Specific, earned reactions to her creative work
- Proposals that solve multiple problems at once
- Being asked clarifying questions rather than having assumptions made
- Fast, focused execution with room for iteration

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

**Lynn A. Haller, MSW, LCSW**
The client and author. Trauma-informed therapist and educator with 25+ years of experience in Pennsylvania. She's both the content creator and the subject-matter authority on IFS. Maya handles all the technical/strategic coordination; Lynn provides clinical direction, manuscript content, and final approval on creative decisions. Lynn's voice is warm, story-led, vulnerable-but-authoritative — Maya is careful to preserve this in any content work.

**Justyna (N-GROUP)**
The illustrator. Creates rich, saturated, painterly-realistic illustrations for the book's interior. The working dynamic is: Lynn and Maya provide direction (via the Illustrator Guide and Visual Style Guide), Justyna executes. The text-over-illustration problem is the current friction point in this relationship — the alternating layout proposal is partly designed to reduce the burden on Justyna to accommodate text placement.

**Maya's role:**
Publisher and web dev. She's not just a vendor — she's deeply embedded in the project. She's the one synthesizing input from Lynn, managing Justyna's constraints, handling production decisions, and running the website. She's effectively a co-producer of the book launch.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

**Text placement on illustrations:**
The core unsolved production problem. Justyna's illustrations are rich and saturated — placing text over them is visually messy and hard to read. Maya's alternating page layout proposal is the current best solution, but it hasn't been approved by Lynn yet and hasn't been implemented with Justyna.

**Page count / printing costs:**
KDP's 75-page minimum is a constraint. Lulu at $15/hardcover is the current option being used, but cost vs. quality tradeoffs are ongoing. The alternating layout would naturally increase page count, which could help with KDP minimums if they switch.

**Pricing:**
$19.99 is the working target, but this is still in discussion. No final decision documented.

**IFS accuracy in content:**
Any content created for the book, website, or promotional materials has to be accurate to IFS principles. The distinction between "parts" and emotions is one example of where well-intentioned but imprecise language can undermine the clinical credibility of the work.

**Iterative approval loop:**
Many decisions require Lynn's input before they can move forward (layout, pricing, text). This is appropriate, but it creates a dependency that can slow production.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Alternating page layout proposal**
- **Decision:** Propose interleaving solid-color text pages (colors pulled from adjacent illustration palettes) with full-bleed illustration pages, rather than overlaying text on illustrations.
- **Alternatives considered:** Text overlay with strategic "quiet zones" in illustrations; simplified illustration style to create negative space; text in dedicated panels.
- **Reasoning:** Solves readability without requiring Justyna to redesign artwork. Maintains visual cohesion by pulling colors from the illustration palette. Doubles page count (helps with printing minimums). Makes the book feel more substantial. Aligns with the painterly-realistic aesthetic.
- **Status:** Proposed, pending Lynn's review.

**Lulu for printing (current)**
- **Decision:** Use Lulu at $15/hardcover as primary print option.
- **Alternatives considered:** KDP (rejected at current page count due to 75-page minimum).
- **Status:** Working assumption, not finalized.

**$19.99 pricing target**
- **Decision:** Target retail price of $19.99.
- **Status:** In discussion, not finalized.

**Em dash removal (site-wide)**
- **Decision:** Remove em dashes throughout website content and Lynn's written materials, replacing with cleaner prose alternatives.
- **Reasoning:** Aesthetic/stylistic preference for cleaner, more readable prose.
- **Status:** Implemented.

**Brand styling**
- **Decision:** Lavender background (#a78fbf), Merriweather Sans font.
- **Status:** Implemented on lynnahaller.com.

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

**On IFS terminology:** Never confuse "parts" with "emotions." In IFS, parts are protective internal voices with specific jobs — they're not the same as feelings. This distinction matters enormously to Lynn and will be caught immediately if you blur it. The book is specifically built around this framework.

**On the alternating layout:** This is the active production problem as of this handoff. The proposal exists; it hasn't been approved. If Maya brings it up, she's likely either checking status or ready to move forward. Don't re-pitch the concept — she already knows it. Just help her execute or communicate it.

**On Lynn's voice:** When working on blog content, editorial copy, or anything in Lynn's voice — she writes as a teacher who leads with story. Vulnerability is her authority. Her best work is sensory, honest about partial victories, and comfortable with paradox. See the Style Guide and Blog Goals documents for the full picture. Don't let AI-smoothed prose flatten her natural rhythm.

**On precision:** Maya will notice if you're imprecise, and she won't be gentle about it. That's a feature, not a bug — it's how she operates. Match her energy.

**On the book's emotional architecture:** The Hallway of Doorknobs has a very specific emotional arc across its 14 spreads — cool curiosity → warm integration. Each "part" character (Cactus, Lava/Blazer, Vanish, Disco, Cozy, Balloon & Bolt, Freeze) has a specific emotional story and color palette. The Illustrator Guide is the master reference. If you're helping with any content tied to specific spreads, read it carefully.

**On ClickUp:** Field UUIDs matter. If you're creating tasks, you need the actual UUID values for custom fields — don't guess them. Maya will have them.

**On the website:** It's WordPress/Elementor at lynnahaller.com. Database is MySQL. She handles her own CSS debugging. If you're helping with technical site work, ask for specifics rather than assuming a standard setup.

**On the launch timeline:** May 12, 2026. That date is real and she's working toward it. Everything connects back to that deadline. If you're helping prioritize work, that's your north star.

**On communication:** Skip the bullet points when you can. She reads prose faster than she reads lists. Match her energy — if she's terse, be terse. If she's in a creative groove, go there with her.
