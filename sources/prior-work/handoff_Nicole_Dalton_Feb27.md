## 2. What Are We Building?

We are building:

1. A thought-leadership article series focused on personal injury.
2. A structured internal linking ecosystem across her website.
3. Clean, SEO-optimized HTML formatting standards.
4. Unified JSON-LD schema for all pages using @graph.
5. A repeatable publishing workflow (Structure → HTML cleanup → Schema → Validation → Meta).

This is not casual blog writing. This is engineered authority content.

## 3. Core Strategic Positioning

Nicole’s brand voice must consistently communicate:

- Fierce courtroom advocate
- Strategic litigator
- Calm, caring guide
- Not afraid to take cases to trial
- Protects clients from insurance tactics

We avoid generic claims like “experienced” or “compassionate.”

We demonstrate credibility through:
- Case examples

- Specific litigation tactics
- Testimonials
- Professional memberships
- Clear contingency fee explanation

This supports EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).

## 4. Article Structure Standard (Required)

Every personal injury article must follow this structure:

1. Headline + Subheadline
2. One-Sentence Hook (bolded line expanded into 2–3 sentences)
3. Quick Answers (FAQ block, Smart Brevity)
4. Scene-Setting Section
5. Case Example (anonymized)
6. Nicole’s Take (mini-op-ed paragraph)
7. Practical Steps (short prose, not bullets)
8. Client Testimonial (unused real quote when available)
9. Localized CTA (Vancouver / Clark County)

Tone Rules:
- Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences)
- No walls of text
- No clichés
- Direct second-person voice (“you”)
- Clear, quotable sentences

---

## 5. Website Architecture & Internal Linking

We mapped the entire Dalton Law Office site into clusters:

Primary Clusters:
- Personal Injury
- Criminal Defense
- DUI Defense
- Family Law
- Spanish-language content

The personal injury cluster includes:

- Main Personal Injury page
- Automobile Collisions
- Boating Accidents
- Personal Injury Q&A
- Fee explanation pages

Every new article must include suggested contextual internal links such as:
- Comparative negligence
- Insurance adjuster tactics
- DUI science (when relevant)
- Licensing consequences (if applicable)

Internal linking builds topical authority and strengthens crawl structure.

## 6. HTML Cleanup Standards

Before publishing, all articles must:

- Be wrapped in <section class="wrapzone">
- Use clean <h2> headings in Title Case
- Remove inline styles and spans
- Keep semantic tags only (<b>, <i>)
- Preserve lists but remove styling attributes
- Fix quotes to curly quotes in visible copy
- Strip unnecessary attributes
- Place FAQ section before the third <h2>
- Wrap FAQ in <section class="faq-box">

We do not add <p> tags (WordPress handles them).

---

## 7. Schema Strategy

All pages use a single JSON-LD block with @graph.

Possible node types:
- WebPage
- BlogPosting (for thought leadership articles)
- FAQPage (when applicable)
- LegalService (Dalton Law Office entity node)

Required Fields:
- headline
- description
- author (Nicole T. Dalton)
- publisher reference
- image
- canonical URL
- mainEntityOfPage

Optional but recommended:
- datePublished
- dateModified
- keywords
- articleSection
- inLanguage

We must never invent facts or fabricate outcomes.

After schema generation:
- Provide a schema validator link
- Provide a strong meta description

---

## 8. Testimonials & Social Proof

We maintain a bank of real testimonials including:

- Criminal defense victories
- Appeals success
- DUI defense outcomes
- Personal injury gratitude statements
- Peer endorsements from other attorneys

When writing injury articles:
- Use only unused quotes
- Match testimonial tone to article topic
- Never fabricate testimonials
