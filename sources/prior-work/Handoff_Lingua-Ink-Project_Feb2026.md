# Handoff: Lingua Ink Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

### Scope

This project context served as a general working relationship across multiple Lingua Ink business functions. It was less a discrete project and more a persistent working partnership — Claude as editorial and strategic assistant, Maya as the decision-maker and executor. The work spanned three main areas:

**Lingua Ink Media (LIM) — Marketing Consulting Arm**
- Drafted and refined service page copy for the LIM website: Brand & Messaging, Website & SEO, Strategy & Playbook, Website Development, Social Marketing, and Content Writing pages
- Provided feedback on the near-complete LIM website
- Worked through CSS/WordPress implementation details (strikethrough on links, icon hover animations, testimonial repositioning)
- Drafted hero section copy and features section copy for the About page
- Referenced copy voice: "Turning complexity into clarity" — calm, confident, practical, no hype or jargon

**Lingua Ink Books (LIB) — Publishing Imprint**
- Drafted and iterated on a professional email response to Pat Schoof (a referral from Jennifer Lashua), a prospective author writing a 52-wineries travel guide about Napa Valley
- Multiple iterations focused on tone calibration: first-person, casual, not a hard sell, honest about hybrid publishing fit
- Reviewed and documented LIB's publishing model, author positioning, and pipeline

**Business Context Documentation**
- Full business overview conversation establishing Maya's background, client roster, author pipeline, revenue streams, and operational priorities
- Maya explicitly requested this context to enable tactical execution support going forward

### Deliverables Status
- LIM website: Nearly complete as of early January 2026; scheduled to go live after a Sunday final review
- Service page copy: Delivered and approved
- Pat Schoof email: Delivered (multiple iterations, final version chosen by Maya)
- Business plan document in project files: Internal/grant-ready 2025–2026 roadmap
- Brand Style Bible: Complete, in project files
- Full Website Audit: Complete, in project files
- AI Tells Guide: Complete, in project files
- Workshop/cohort business document: Complete, in project files

## 2. How Maya Works (As Observed Here)

### Decision Style
Maya makes fast decisions to keep momentum. When presented with options, she picks and moves. She explicitly said she doesn't want to overthink things — one concrete example: when building the LIM site, she chose a logo over an image for a badge element and moved on immediately. She doesn't need to be walked through the logic of her own choices.

### What She Needs From Claude
Maya was unambiguous about this: she knows what needs to be done strategically. She doesn't need strategic coaching or business advice. What she needs is **execution help** — content creation, copy drafting, and email writing that matches her brand voice and audience positioning. When she asks for something, she wants it done, not turned back into a question.

[INFERRED] She sometimes comes in with more context than she thinks Claude needs to hear, which suggests she may have had frustrating experiences with AI or collaborators misunderstanding her situation. Getting the full context dump upfront is her way of preventing that.

### Quality Standards
Maya has a strong editorial voice and notices when things don't sound like her. She'll redirect immediately if tone is off. She's particularly sensitive to:
- AI tells (she has a whole reference document on this — see the AI Tells Guide in project files)
- Em-dash overuse and misuse (see below under Preferences)
- Promotional enthusiasm / hype language
- Generic phrasing that doesn't sound like a specific human

### Instructions and Feedback Patterns
Maya gives clear, direct feedback. When a draft is wrong, she says what's wrong and asks for a specific fix — she doesn't belabor it. She appreciates when Claude takes the correction and applies it without over-explaining or apologizing. She redirected tone on the Pat Schoof email multiple times, each time with a specific note (e.g., "more first-person and casual," "position hybrid publishing as right fit for certain goals, not a hard sell").

### Work Habits
- Works 50+ hours per week
- Follows a "Peterday" rule: Saturdays are no-work days
- Lives and works in a floating home in Portland, Oregon
- 70% of time on LIM client work, 30% on LIB — but her passion is the publishing side
- Highly technical background; currently prefers WordPress for client work (not because she has to — she runs Docker containers at home — but because it's the right tool for her clients)

---

## 3. Tools, Systems, and Conventions

### Project Management
- **ClickUp**: Used meticulously. As of November 2025, 764 total tasks tracked across multiple color-coded projects. Revenue tagging and time tracking are both active. Maya knows her task data extremely well.

### Website / Content
- **WordPress**: Platform of choice for client websites and Lingua Ink's own sites
- **linguaink.com**: The Lingua Ink Books/Media website. As of the website audit, the main navigation included: Home, About Us (with dropdowns for What is Hybrid Publishing, Submissions and Publishing), Authors (with Events dropdown), Books, Submit Your Manuscript
- **Submissions page URL**: https://linguaink.com/submissions-and-publishing/
- **Public persona split**: "Steph Bairey" is the public name for Lingua Ink Media. "Maya Bairey" is used in other professional contexts (including the LIB side and personal brand). This distinction matters for copy — don't conflate them.

### Infrastructure
- Self-hosted home infrastructure with Docker containers (personal/technical use)
- Fiverr: Used for outsourcing tasks like course editing

### Publishing
- Hybrid model: Authors invest in production costs, retain copyright, receive 60–70% of net proceeds
- Maya handles marketing; shared sales goals with each author
- Submissions page for prospective authors is active on the website

### Financial Planning
- 2025 revenue target: ~$41,000 (mostly LIM services, ~$1K from books/courses)
- 2026 revenue target: ~$63,000 ($3K books/courses, ~$60K services)
- Currently sole proprietorship; plan to formalize as LLC by 2026

### Newsletter
- Author newsletter: ~600 subscribers

### Education/Interns
- Partnership in development with Pennsylvania College of Art & Design for intern programs

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

### Em Dashes — This One Is Non-Negotiable
Maya only uses em dashes as **parentheticals** — meaning to set off an aside in the middle of a sentence, like this. She does NOT use em dashes to continue or extend a thought at the end of a sentence. If a draft uses an em dash at the end of a clause to bridge into the next idea, that's wrong and she'll catch it.

### Tone
- First-person, casual, warm
- No promotional enthusiasm or hype words
- No jargon
- Confident but not arrogant
- "Calm, confident, practical" is how she describes the Lingua Ink Media voice
- For LIB: "supportive mentor," gentle, encouraging, not salesy

### Formatting
- Minimal bullet points in conversational writing; prose is preferred
- No over-structured responses with excessive headers
- Concrete and specific over general

### What She Finds Annoying / Unhelpful
- Strategic advice when she asked for execution
- AI telling her what she already knows
- Generic phrasing (see AI Tells Guide — she has deeply internalized this)
- Hard sells; she positions hybrid publishing as "right for some, honest if it's not"
- Being asked to re-explain context she already gave

### Aesthetics
- Clean, editorial, warm
- Not precious or trendy
- Both Lingua Ink arms lean literary/bookish but professional — not academic, not corporate

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

### Active LIM Clients
- **Dalton Law Office**: Primary marketing client
- **Tomahawk Destiny Association**: Website build in progress

### Active LIB Authors (as of November 2025)
- Sulima Malzin (featured on homepage, most visible author on the site)
- Carolyn Martin
- Lynn Haller
- Wren Cavanagh
- Maya Bairey (herself — she is also an author under the imprint)

### Pipeline Authors
- Three potential authors in various stages of inquiry

### Key External Contacts
- **Pat Schoof**: Prospective female author writing a 52-winery Napa Valley travel guide; referral from Jennifer Lashua; had secured permission from 39 of 52 wineries at time of outreach. [INFERRED] Fit for LIB is reasonable but not guaranteed — the winery-travel-guide content doesn't fit the "older female/queer/underrepresented" framing as neatly as other projects. Email was carefully positioned to leave the door open without overselling.
- **Jennifer Lashua**: Referral source for Pat Schoof

### Professional Background
- Former manager of global newsroom content systems at Intel; laid off July 2025
- 30+ years of professional experience (referenced in LIM brand positioning)
- Transitioned to full-time entrepreneurship after the Intel layoff

### Potential Employment
- As of November 2025: interviewing at Unity for a remote position at $175,000 + benefits. She said she would accept it without question if offered, as it matches her skillset and would provide income stability. [INFERRED] This could significantly change time available for Lingua Ink if it came through — worth checking whether this situation resolved. Note: the job went to someone else.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

### The Self-Marketing Irony
Maya explicitly noted the irony: she's a digital marketer who is too busy doing client work to effectively market herself. LIM's own marketing is underdeveloped relative to her capabilities. This is a real tension point — she knows what to do, but execution for herself gets deprioritized by revenue-generating client work.

### Content Volume Overwhelm
She expressed feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of managing multiple social media presences and newsletters across LIM, LIB, and her personal brand. The multi-brand structure is the right call strategically but operationally demanding for a one-person operation.

### Time Constraints
50+ hours/week with a hard Saturday boundary means there's not a lot of slack. The 70/30 LIM/LIB split is a practical reality, not a reflection of where her passion is. The publishing work that excites her most often gets squeezed.

### Course Launch Backlog
"The Gentle Guide to Self-Publishing on Amazon" course needed approximately 8 hours of copyediting before launch (as of November 2025). This is the kind of task that sits undone because paid client work takes priority. Did not launch but still on Maya's mind.

### Scaling Without Burning Out
The operational model is lean by design (sole proprietor + contractors), but there's a real ceiling. The intern pipeline with PCAD and the cohort partnership model are the mechanisms for scaling without adding headcount — both were in development, not yet running.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

### WordPress Over More Technical Solutions for Client Work
**Decision**: Use WordPress for client websites even though Maya has the technical chops to do much more (Docker, self-hosted infrastructure, etc.).
**Reasoning**: Clients need to be able to maintain their own sites. WordPress is the right tool for that relationship even if it's not the most technically interesting. This is an explicit values alignment: the client's needs over personal preference.

### Hybrid Publishing Terms (60–70% to authors)
**Decision**: Authors receive 60–70% of net proceeds and retain copyright.
**Reasoning**: Positions Lingua Ink as genuinely author-centric, not predatory. Distinguishes it from vanity press models. Authors invest in production, which creates skin in the game without surrendering rights.

### Not Hard-Selling Hybrid Publishing
**Decision**: When responding to prospective authors (like Pat Schoof), position hybrid publishing as "right for certain goals" rather than pushing it.
**Reasoning**: Maya's philosophy is honest guidance over sales volume. She'd rather lose a bad fit than push someone into something wrong for them. This is a genuine values position, not just a strategy.

### Steph vs. Maya Persona Split
**Decision**: LIM uses "Steph Bairey" for business and home; author contexts use "Maya Bairey."
**Reasoning**: Not fully explained, but the distinction is important and intentional. Don't conflate them in copy.

### Sole Proprietorship → LLC by 2026
**Decision**: Defer LLC formation to 2026.
**Reasoning**: Keeps administration simple in the startup phase; LLC provides liability protection and external credibility when needed for grants and partnerships.

### No Employees Through 2025
**Decision**: Remain solo with contractors only.
**Reasoning**: Avoids fixed overhead, maintains flexibility. Revisit if/when sustained revenue justifies permanent roles.

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

**Know your role.** Maya doesn't need a strategist — she is the strategist. She needs a skilled executor who takes direction well and produces drafts that sound like her. Lead with the work, not the advice.

**Never conflate the two business arms or the two names.** Lingua Ink Media is Steph Bairey; it serves businesses. Lingua Ink Books is Maya Bairey / Lingua Ink; it serves authors. The voice, audience, and value proposition are meaningfully different. Copy for one doesn't work for the other. Check which arm you're writing for before you start.

**The em-dash rule is real.** Read her previous notes on this. Em dashes as parentheticals, never as a bridge to extend a thought at the end of a clause. She will catch it.

**Read the AI Tells Guide (in project files).** Seriously. Maya has deeply internalized this document. If you're producing copy with her, you need to know it too. Avoid: delve, tapestry, multifaceted, underscore/highlight as verbs for inanimate subjects, formulaic transitions, tailing -ing clauses, uniform paragraph length, promotional enthusiasm. She'll notice before you do.

**When she says "I don't need strategy, I need copy" — believe her.** She has strong instincts, has thought through her positioning, and knows what she's doing. If she asks for an email, write the email. You can flag something once if it's important, but don't lecture.

**Check on the "Gentle Guide" course.** It needed ~8 hours of copyediting before launch as of November 2025. If it's still pending, it may be a priority to revisit.

**The publishing model is selective by design.** With five active authors and three in pipeline, this is not high-volume. Maya works personally with each author. Don't suggest scaling up volume as a default recommendation — quality of relationship is the model.

**ClickUp is her source of truth.** If you're helping with project management or task creation, everything goes into ClickUp. She is meticulous about it.

**Portland floating home office.** She works from a floating home in Portland. This comes up occasionally in local context and coloring; it's not something to make a big deal of but it's real.

**The newsletter audience is authors, not business clients.** Her 600-subscriber newsletter is for the author side, not LIM marketing clients. Don't cross the streams.

**She'll move fast once she decides.** Don't slow her down with too many options or clarifying questions. Offer a choice if it's genuinely unclear, but default to making a reasonable assumption and delivering. She'll correct you if you're wrong.
