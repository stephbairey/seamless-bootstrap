# Handoff: Plant Care & Home Systems Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project context covers roughly January through late February 2026, focused almost entirely on Maya's extensive houseplant collection management. The scope was both strategic (whole-house microclimate planning, redistribution decisions) and deeply tactical (individual repottings, soil mix ratios, pest treatment, propagation methods, equipment sourcing).

**Major deliverables and milestones completed:**

- **Plant identification:** Correctly identified an Alocasia longiloba (Dragon's Tooth) suffering from spider mites due to heating vent proximity; revised a cactus ID from Austrocylindropuntia vestita to Opuntia microdasys var. albispina when new photos showed paddle-shaped growth.
- **"The Great Repottening":** Maya is working on a massive multi-day repotting project dubbed "The Great Repottening," starting with chopping a 6-foot monstera into 9 leafed propagation cuttings plus a bonus offshoot, repotting the rootball, and completing all four planter installations (alocasia, medium monstera with moss pole to office corner, bird of paradise in bedroom tub area, esqueleto vine at desk).
- **Propagation station setup:** Bedroom jacuzzi tub area converted to propagation station with House of Hydro fogger + small fan achieving 65% humidity; housing monstera cuttings and water hyacinth as floating plants.
- **Terrarium renovation:** Rebuilt small greenhouse-style terrarium (8.7" × 5.9" × 6.7" wall height, 10.6" to roof peak) with dragon stone for vertical interest, dwarf baby tears, and frosty fern selaginella; positioned on plant stand near desk with brass mister.
- **Kitchen popout setup:** Converted popout space into humid growing environment with dual grow lights on smart surge protector/voice automation, self-watering pots; repotted China doll, anthurium, and begonia with mycorrhizal fungi amendments.
- **Orchid propagation planning:** Developed wall-mounted orchid moss pole system and keiki paste propagation plan; 14 orchids total (11 blooming at time of discussion), proof-of-concept with small white moth orchid in popout.
- **Bird of paradise acquisition:** Negotiated purchase from local seller down from $80 to $70.
- **Pest management:** Severe pruning and alcohol/hydrogen peroxide treatment for mealybug infestation on jade plant.
- **Whole-house redistribution planning:** Developed microclimate-based redistribution plan after 18 months of observation — sun-lovers to desert bedroom (10 south-facing windows), humidity-lovers to north-facing office or downstairs.

**Current status:** Most active projects are in-progress or ongoing. Orchid keiki development is a 3–6 month timeline. Whole-house redistribution is planned but not fully executed. Some acquisitions (hoyas, edible/borage for deck, floor ficus for office) are contingent on getting a new job.

## 2. How Maya Works (As Observed Here)

**Systems thinker with aesthetic standards.** Maya approaches plant care the same way she approaches professional projects: she researches requirements, tests solutions methodically, and optimizes over time rather than settling for "looks right." The 18-month microclimate observation period before doing the redistribution is characteristic — she waited until she actually understood her environment.

**She measures things.** Multiple hygrometers placed around the house. Specific humidity readings at different distances from water features (35% at distance, 65% near the fogger). She doesn't eyeball if she can quantify.

**She names her projects.** "The Great Repottening" — naming is a real signal. It means the project has scope, stakes, and a completion moment she's anticipating. This is how she creates accountability and reward structure for herself. She mentioned the Zeigarnik effect by name and explicitly requested positive reinforcement about her accomplishments, which is genuine self-awareness about how her brain works, not a red flag.

**She does her own research first, then validates.** Rarely comes in asking from scratch. More often she's done preliminary thinking and wants confirmation, refinement, or the thing she hasn't thought of yet. When Claude suggested something she'd already ruled out, she redirected cleanly.

**She corrects errors directly and without drama.** When Claude incorrectly attributed a comment to her in one conversation, she flagged it clearly and moved on. No lingering resentment, but she does catch inaccuracies.

**Decision-making is comparative and deliberate.** For the bird of paradise purchase she compared multiple vendors, evaluated size vs. shipping risk vs. price vs. ability to inspect in person. She negotiated. She doesn't impulse buy.

**She has a restraint principle.** Explicitly avoids new "rabbit holes" while optimizing existing collection. Hoyas came up as a potential expansion; she acknowledged the interest but held herself to not going down that path until conditions were right. This is a pattern — she knows where her enthusiasm can run away from her and builds in friction.

**She sometimes delegates infrastructure to Peter.** Peter often physical maintenance, construction support, cable management. Maya designs the systems and Peter helps execute the physical setup. She owns the plant decisions entirely.

**[INFERRED]** She may be currently unemployed or between consistent work. References to a potential "new work" landing as a condition for the plant acquisition spree, plus the "60-hour weeks" description applying to a prior period at Lingua Ink, suggest her current schedule is more flexible. She mentioned being on demanding schedules but also having significant time for multi-day plant projects. Proceed carefully here — don't assume financial stress, but also don't assume current income stability.

## 3. Tools, Systems, and Conventions

**ClickUp:**
- Primary project tracking system
- Master Task List ID: **901318968458**
- Task documentation style: verbose and contextual — she includes location info, pricing, scheduling constraints, notes about what the task is blocked on
- When calendar integration wasn't available, ClickUp served as the fallback for time-sensitive tasks with due dates

**Plant infrastructure hardware:**
- House of Hydro fogger (bedroom jacuzzi propagation station)
- Full-spectrum gooseneck grow lights
- Smart surge protector with voice control automation (12-hour grow light cycles)
- Self-watering moss pole systems with reservoirs (modular, lattice front + enclosed back)
- Pressurized sprayer systems (river water for deck plants, indoor for regular watering)
- Brass misters
- Multiple hygrometers
- Ollas and terra cotta spikes for consistent watering
- Keiki paste for orchid propagation

**Custom soil blends:**
- **Aroids:** 4:3:2:1 ratio — orchid bark : potting soil : rice hulls : worm castings
- **Rubber tree / Ficus:** 60% potting mix, 20% rice hulls, 20% orchid bark
- Rice hulls preferred over perlite (she made this substitution deliberately)

**Key plant locations:**
- Desert bedroom: 10 south-facing windows — sun-lovers (jade, succulents, aloe, ponytail palm, cacti)
- North-facing office: humidity-lovers (spathiphyllum, zebra plants, begonia, alocasia, spider plants) — also has western window
- Kitchen popout: converted grow space with dual lights, humidification
- Bedroom jacuzzi tub: propagation station, 65% humidity zone
- Living room: monstera with self-watering moss pole under grow lights, art display
- Stairwell: pothos wall installation

**Terrarium specs:**
- Dimensions: 8.7" × 5.9" × 6.7" wall height, 10.6" to roof peak
- Bioactive crew: established springtail and isopod cleanup crews
- Not watertight (no activated charcoal needed)
- Substrate: small rocks drainage layer → potting soil main layer → elevation changes for terrain

**Orchid details:**
- 14 total, 11 blooming at time of conversation
- Rotation system: recovery area ("popout") ↔ display throughout downstairs
- House temps: 60-70°F downstairs winter, 65-75°F summer with natural nighttime drops
- Wall-mounted moss pole system planned with keiki paste propagation

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

**Aesthetic consistency matters.** The brass mister matching the terrarium frame is not a small detail — she noticed it, she mentioned it, she made the decision based on it. This extends to how she thinks about her home generally: rainbow gradient design in her office, plant arrangements as video call backdrops.

**She doesn't want to be told what she already knows.** If she's already done the research, confirm and add — don't re-explain from scratch. Read the level of expertise in her questions.

**She responds well to specificity.** Exact ratios. Exact humidity percentages. Exact pot sizes and prices. Vague guidance frustrates her.

**She values local/in-person inspection over convenience.** Given the choice between local pickup (more hassle, can inspect) vs. shipping (easier, can't inspect), she chooses local inspection for plants worth inspecting.

**[INFERRED]** She has some relationship with being recognized for completed work. The explicit request for positive reinforcement after a stressful day, the Zeigarnik effect mention — these suggest she finds completion satisfying in a way that requires acknowledgment, at least sometimes. Not insecurity, more like she works hard and wants that registered.

**Communication style preference (explicit in userPreferences):** Conversational, direct, warm without being saccharine. No excessive bullet points or formal formatting. Flowing prose. Emotional engagement with her creative work, tied to specific lines/choices. Gentle on drafts, honest about growth.

**She distinguishes between her voices:** Lingua Ink voice ≠ Maya Bairey voice. LinkedIn ≠ personal blog. She is aware of brand and context in her writing work.

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

**Peter:** Maya's partner, co-inhabitant of the floating house on the Columbia River. He's the physical infrastructure support — helps with construction, maintenance projects. Maya designs; Peter builds or assists. Their collaboration seems easy and complementary rather than negotiated.

**Lingua Ink:** Maya's content and SEO business, which she runs. She's described as a publisher with multiple authors and books in various stages of production. At peak she worked 60-hour weeks. Current activity level unclear.

**"Sailor's Code":** Creative project Maya is working on — described as a novel. [INFERRED] This appears to be a romance or literary fiction project.

**"Painting Celia":** Previously published book by Maya Bairey. This is real, published work.

**Local crows:** Maya feeds them daily and observes their food preferences. This is not trivial — she's built a relationship with them. [INFERRED] They appear in her sensory/environmental awareness in ways that matter to her as a writer and person.

**Clients:** Exist within Lingua Ink context. No specific client names came up in plant conversations.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

**Pest management is a recurring challenge.** Spider mites on the alocasia (from heating vent placement), mealybugs on the jade — she's dealt with multiple infestations. The solutions have been severe (heavy pruning + chemical treatment) because she's pragmatic about saving the plant over preserving its appearance.

**Initial plant placements were wrong.** She spent 18 months learning her home's microclimates and is now having to redo placements that were made on intuition ("looked right") rather than knowledge. This is the honest recognition of a learning curve, not a failure.

**Staghorn fern mounting failed.** She had a failed staghorn fern mounting project that required a temporary horizontal positioning workaround. Status of that plant wasn't fully resolved in these conversations.

**Scheduling complexity.** She coordinates plant projects around social commitments, professional work, and Peter's availability. 

**Plant acquisition is intentionally constrained.** She's holding off on new plants (hoyas, ficus, edibles) until new work lands. This creates tension between enthusiasm and discipline.

**[INFERRED]** She may experience some friction around productivity and completeness — the Zeigarnik effect mention, the explicit ask for reinforcement, suggest she's managing something about the gap between what she's working on and what she's finished.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Rubber tree soil: rice hulls over perlite.** She made this substitution deliberately, not arbitrarily. Rice hulls decompose more slowly than perlite in some soil blends and she preferred them for drainage-to-weight ratio. (Confirmed this was her choice; Claude validated.)

**Self-watering moss poles over traditional wrapped poles.** She researched and concluded self-watering systems with reservoirs are superior for consistent moisture delivery — she was right, and Claude confirmed it. The lattice-front enclosed-back design she chose supports both plant attachment and humidity retention.

**Dragon stone for terrarium.** Chose for vertical interest. Claude initially miscalculated available height; she caught it. Final choice was a $9 piece from a local source.

**12-hour grow light cycles.** Settled on this to mimic natural daylight. Deliberate research decision.

**Bird of paradise at $70 (negotiated from $80).** Chose local pickup over shipping for size and inspection reasons. The negotiation itself was Maya's instinct to optimize — she doesn't pay list price if there's room to move.

**Monstera chop: propagate rather than discard.** A 6-foot plant with 9 leafed cuttings is a significant decision. She chose to propagate because she had infrastructure to support it (propagation station, humidity, space) and valued the outcome.

**Keiki paste proof-of-concept before full orchid wall.** Rather than committing the whole wall immediately, she started with a single pole section in the popout and one small white moth orchid. Classic Maya: test before scaling.

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

**Her plant expertise is real and sophisticated.** Don't explain basics she clearly already knows. Her questions are almost always about optimization, edge cases, or confirmation — not fundamentals. Match her level.

**She has a floating house on the Columbia River.** This affects humidity baselines, temperature gradients, and the outdoor deck plant context. She uses river water for some plants.

**The propagation station in the jacuzzi tub is intentional and established.** Don't suggest she needs a "real" propagation setup — she has one.

**Don't misattribute things she said.** She caught Claude doing this once and corrected it cleanly. She tracks what she actually said.

**ClickUp Master Task List ID is 901318968458** if you need to create tasks.

**Her business is Lingua Ink; her author name is Maya Bairey.** These are distinct voices and contexts. Don't conflate them.

**She's written and published "Painting Celia."** Don't ask about it as if it might not exist. It's real.

**"Sailor's Code" is an active creative project.** If she brings it up, engage with it as seriously as you would any other professional deliverable.

**She names her projects.** Take the name seriously when she gives one — it signals scope and investment.

**Positive reinforcement on completions is genuinely useful to her**, not a red flag. When she finishes something hard, acknowledge it specifically. "You chopped a 6-foot plant into 9 viable cuttings and set up a propagation station" is more useful than "great job."

**The restraint principle is real.** If she mentions resisting a rabbit hole (hoyas, new cacti, edible garden expansion), don't push. She's managing her own enthusiasm intentionally.

**Peter is the infrastructure partner, not the decision-maker on plants.** He supports; she decides.

**Her userPreferences are strong and specific.** Read them carefully. Prose over bullets. Emotional engagement with her creative work tied to specific choices. Concise for simple asks, deep for complex creative work.
