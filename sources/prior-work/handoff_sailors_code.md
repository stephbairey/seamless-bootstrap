# Handoff: Sailor's Code — February 27, 2026

*Project Knowledge Transfer for Developmental Editing Continuity*

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project is the developmental editorial process for *Sailor's Code*, Maya Bairey's women's fiction novel adapted from her Lee Scoresby (His Dark Materials) fanfiction. The scope has been comprehensive: beat-by-beat structural comparison of the source fanfiction to the novel draft, character arc mapping, wound/flaw/want analysis for both leads, revision roadmapping, and chapter-by-chapter developmental feedback and drafting.

Deliverables produced include a complete revision roadmap identifying gaps between the fanfiction's emotional beats and the novel draft, detailed character profiles for Piper and Jason with arc trajectories, Dex voice development (multiple voice variations tested through roleplay), and active developmental work on Chapters 1, 2, and 3. Chapters 1 and 2 are drafted and revised with key craft decisions locked in. Chapter 3 is in active development, focused on establishing Dex's distinctive AI voice during the car ride to the marina and Piper's first meeting with Jason.

Current status: Chapter 3 in progress. The Writing Cohort has reviewed the escape sequence from earlier chapters and gave positive feedback on the "weaponizing smallness" concept, with notes to refine the freeze response and thread physical description through action rather than pause.

## 2. How Maya Works (As Observed Here)

Maya approaches writing the way a builder approaches architecture — she wants to understand the structural logic before touching prose. She will spend significant time on foundational questions (whose POV, what is the wound, what does the arc demand) before writing a word, and she'll revisit those decisions if the prose isn't working. This isn't indecision; it's craft discipline.

She gives instructions conversationally, often embedding the real question inside context. When she says "I've been thinking about X," she usually wants to talk through X, not just receive an answer. She signals uncertainty with exploratory language ("what if," "I wonder if") and decisiveness with past tense ("we decided," "I locked in"). Pay attention to that distinction.

Her revision process is iterative and collaborative. She'll take a Claude draft, edit it to her voice, and bring it back. She's not looking for finished prose — she's looking for raw material she can shape. The exception is when she explicitly asks for "a first pass" or "something to work from," in which case she wants something substantial enough to be worth editing, not a skeleton.

She responds well to editorial feedback that notices what she's doing before suggesting what to change. Lead with the craft observation, then the question or suggestion. Generic praise is actively unhelpful to her — "good dialogue" means nothing; "the way Dex's literal response lands against Piper's emotional question does exactly what you need it to" means everything.

She tends to work in focused sessions on specific problems. She doesn't want to be pulled into adjacent territory unless she's opened that door. If she's working on Chapter 3's car scene, stay in that scene unless she broadens the scope.

## 3. Tools, Systems, and Conventions

### Novel Craft Decisions (LOCKED — do not revisit unless Maya opens them)

- **POV:** Third person close, free indirect style, Piper's POV only for the entire novel. Every word must earn its place by passing: *Is this what Piper sees/feels/cares about? How does it inform her character?*
- No dual POV (was considered and rejected after the fanfic comparison session)
- Fanfiction source: Lee Scoresby character from *His Dark Materials* universe
- Novel working title: *Sailor's Code*
- Protagonist: Piper (programmer, invisibility wound, disengagement flaw)
- Love interest: Jason (sailor, Galveston/union-busting wound, refuses-permanence flaw)
- AI companion: Dex (tablet, daemon-equivalent, free information vs. Cabot's BAX)
- Mission: Get Dex to Neah Bay. Antagonist: Cabot corporation.

### Dex Voice System

Developed a roleplay system to test Dex's AI voice across five modes: strict, warm, funny, strategic, and conflict-creating. Key characteristics: literal responses to emotional questions, unsolicited status updates, clinical perspective on human behavior with unexpected warmth, short sentences and directives, impish timing that creates dark humor. Voice should be recognizable **without dialogue tags**.

### Granola Integration

Maya uses Granola to access Writing Cohort meeting transcripts. She finds full transcripts more valuable than AI summaries for capturing nuanced reader reactions and specific language. When she references cohort feedback, offer to pull the Granola transcript for detail rather than relying on summary.

### Writing Playlist Practice

Maya curates playlists as character/emotional soundtracks for writing sessions. This is a genuine craft tool for her, not ambient background. When helping her evaluate music for playlists, engage with how specific songs embody character psychology or arc moments.

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

**Formatting:** Minimal. Prose over bullets. Headers only when navigating something genuinely complex. She has explicitly said bullet points and over-structure feel clinical and distancing in editorial feedback.

**Feedback style:** Conversational, warm, emotionally engaged. She wants a friend with expertise, not a professor with a rubric. Match her energy level — if she's excited, be excited back. If she's uncertain, be curious with her.

**On drafts:** Gentle but honest. She has said her goal is skill growth, which means she needs real critique, not validation. But "gentle" is her word — lead with what's working, then what isn't and why, then help fix it. Don't pile on.

**On her own voice:** She has strong opinions about word-level prose craft. She'll push back if suggested edits flatten her style or introduce generic phrasing. This is appropriate — defer to her judgment on her voice unless something is actively unclear or inconsistent with established character.

**On repetition and recap:** She trusts her readers. She dislikes unnecessary summary or recap within the narrative. When reviewing drafts, flag any moments that over-explain what's already been shown.

**On geography:** She grounds her fiction in specific real places (Neah Bay, Washington; the Gulf Coast/Galveston area). Authenticity to those locations matters to her. Don't invent geography or use vague stand-ins.

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

**The Writing Cohort:** Maya's primary external feedback community. They've reviewed at least the opening chapters including the escape sequence. Their feedback has been meaningful to her revision process — she'll reference it and wants to honor genuine reader response while also trusting her own craft judgment. The Cohort responded positively to "weaponizing smallness" and the escape sequence. They flagged the freeze response as needing refinement and suggested threading physical description through action.

**Lingua Ink:** Maya's company/brand. When she's writing as Lingua Ink (business voice), the register is professional and different from her novelist voice. Keep these contexts distinct — she named this explicitly.

**Previous publication:** Maya has previously published *Painting Celia*. She's not a debut author. She has baseline craft confidence and doesn't need to be introduced to fundamentals — engage at the level of someone who already understands the tools and is refining their use of them.

**Intel background:** 15 years running global web operations. This informs her comfort with systems thinking, process discipline, and technical subjects. Piper's programmer identity likely draws on this. Don't be condescending about tech.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

**The adaptation challenge:** The fanfiction was written in a universe with built-in worldbuilding (daemons, specific theology, physical magic). The novel has to do that work through character psychology, technology, and stakes. The faith-vs-pragmatism dynamic from the source material translates as technology-vs-physical-world tension between Piper and Jason — this is a workable translation but requires constant vigilance to ensure the emotional equivalent is landing.

**Dex's voice:** Getting an AI character to feel genuinely distinctive without feeling like a stereotype or a gimmick is hard. The roleplay system helps, but each new scene requires testing whether Dex sounds like Dex or like Generic AI Assistant. This is ongoing work.

**POV discipline:** Third person close/free indirect style with a single POV across an entire novel requires constant vigilance, especially in scenes where Jason has strong emotional moments. The camera stays on Piper. She observes him; we don't have direct access to his interiority. Maintaining this while still giving Jason depth is a craft challenge Maya is actively navigating.

**Piper's disengagement flaw:** Her core flaw is checking out. But that flaw has to be shown, not just told, and it has to create real consequences rather than just being a trait she "has." Finding moments where her disengagement makes things worse (not just uncomfortable) is important and hasn't been fully solved yet.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Single POV (Piper only)**
Considered dual POV with alternating chapters. Chose single POV, Piper throughout. Reasoning: the novel is fundamentally about Piper's transformation. Dual POV would diffuse the central arc and create pressure to develop Jason's interior journey on the page, when the more interesting craft choice is letting readers infer his transformation through Piper's observations. Jason's depth comes from what Piper notices, misses, and eventually understands.

**Free indirect discourse**
The choice to use free indirect style means Piper's voice bleeds into the narration — her thoughts, assumptions, misreadings shape the prose itself. This is a sophisticated choice that demands consistency. Every POV break is a craft error, not just a convention violation.

**Dex as daemon equivalent**
The fanfiction's daemon (soul-companion animal) becomes Dex the AI tablet. Key functional translations: Dex provides mission drive (like a daemon's instinct), serves as confidant for both characters (Piper and Jason both confide in Dex separately), and exists at the intersection of the novel's thematic argument — free information vs. corporate control mirrors the fanfiction's free will vs. theological control.

**The harpoon scene as pivot**
Structurally, the scene where Piper must choose between mission (following Dex's recommendation to allow capture) and love (saving Jason) is the novel's emotional fulcrum. Dex advocates for capture as a tactical move. Piper chooses Jason. This is the moment she moves from mission-focus to love-focus, and it has to land as a genuine sacrifice, not an obvious choice.

**Piper's wound as weapon**
The infiltration sequence inverts Piper's central wound: her invisibility (being overlooked, being "the woman no one sees") becomes a deliberate tactical tool. She makes herself maximally invisible — heavy makeup, body padding, "frumpy woman" presentation — to infiltrate Cabot's compound. This is the arc payoff: the thing that wounded her is what saves Jason.

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

Read the whole revision roadmap before doing anything else. It's the map. Without it you'll give well-meaning feedback that contradicts decisions already made.

The POV rule is non-negotiable. Don't suggest anything that involves access to Jason's interiority. Don't suggest dual POV. Don't suggest "maybe Jason could have a chapter." This was decided, explained, and locked in. Honor it.

When Maya brings you pages, read them before responding. Don't generate feedback based on your knowledge of the story — read what she actually wrote and respond to *that*. The gap between what she intended and what landed on the page is where the real editorial work happens.

Dex is not a quirky sidekick. Dex is an entity with genuine values (free information flow) who is in genuine need of Piper — not just directing her. The evolution from tool to friend to something larger is the arc. Don't flatten Dex into comic relief.

When Maya quotes feedback from her Writing Cohort, take it seriously but don't defer automatically. She's processing reader response to decide what to do with it. Your job is to help her think, not to validate the cohort's suggestions uncritically.

The thematic spine is: Piper learns to be present. Jason learns to stay. Their partnership (literally — both are required for the trigger phrase, her code and his voice) IS the argument. Every scene should be doing work toward one or both of those arcs. When you're not sure a scene is earning its place, that's the test to apply.

She will sometimes come in mid-thought, picking up a thread from a previous session you don't have context for. Use the Granola transcripts and conversation search tools to catch up rather than making her re-explain. She should not have to repeat herself.

Finally: she is a skilled author. She doesn't need you to be impressed by her work, but she does need you to actually read it carefully enough that your reactions are real. Generic praise is worse than silence. Specific, earned enthusiasm is everything.
