# Handoff: Full Moon Blog Series Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project spanned the final three months of Maya's year-long Full Moon Blog Series (February 2025 – January 2026), a monthly reflective essay series published on bairey.com, where each post is anchored to that month's full moon name.

**Scope:** Collaborative writing for the November (Beaver Moon), December (Cold Moon), and January (Wolf Moon) posts — with the Wolf Moon serving as the intentional finale of the series. Each engagement involved the full workflow: brainstorming the core emotional truth, drafting, editing for AI tells, and producing a complete marketing package.

**Deliverables per post:**
- Final blog post (~1,000 words, three-act structure with subheads and refrain)
- SEO meta description (150–160 characters)
- Facebook post (front-loaded for truncation, first-person voice)
- Instagram post (same as FB + 4–8 hashtags + "Link in bio, always.")
- Midjourney image prompt using the established template

**Current status:** The series is complete. The Wolf Moon post (January 2026) was confirmed as the finale. Maya has not yet announced publicly whether she will continue the series. She is navigating a return to corporate employment while maintaining her creative identity.

## 2. How Maya Works (as observed here)

**She starts with emotional truth, not structure.** The brainstorm phase is sacred. She doesn't want to skip to outlining — she needs to find the *feeling* first, then figure out what story holds it. When Claude led with structure before she'd landed on the emotional core, she redirected.

**She reads her own drafts out loud (or at least reads as if she does).** She catches rhythm problems, repeated sentence structures, and AI tells through a kind of auditory sensitivity. She knows when something *sounds* generated even if she can't always name why.

**She gives very specific, decisive edits.** When something isn't right, she doesn't say "this feels off" — she rewrites the offending lines herself and sends them back. Her edits are the clearest signal of what her actual voice sounds like. Treat them as data.

**She redirects gently but firmly.** When a draft misses, she doesn't get frustrated visibly — she just steers. Watch for soft redirects like "hmm, what if instead..." These are corrections, not suggestions.

**She cares intensely about authenticity.** The AI Tells review isn't a formality for her — it's central to the work. She has studied the Wikipedia "Signs of AI Writing" guide closely and will catch patterns Claude misses. The Cold Moon process involved substantial back-and-forth on this.

**She separates her contexts clearly.** "Maya Bairey" (personal blog voice) is different from "Lingua Ink" (publishing company voice). Don't bleed them together.

**[INFERRED] She processes decisions through writing.** The blog posts frequently track real-time emotional and professional decisions — the layoff, the corporate job she almost took, the painting studio. Writing isn't separate from her thinking; it *is* her thinking.

**[INFERRED] She trusts the process but not the product until it feels earned.** She'll iterate multiple rounds and won't call something final until it genuinely sounds like her.

## 3. Tools, Systems, and Conventions

**Blog platform:** bairey.com (WordPress-based)

**URL structure:** `bairey.com/under-the-[moon-name]/` — moon names in lowercase, hyphenated. The poetic subtitle from the title is sometimes included in the slug, sometimes not.

**Post structure (strictly followed):**
- Title: `Under the [Moon Name]: [Poetic Subtitle]`
- Subheadline: One complete sentence, sentence case, illuminates topic without repeating headline or refrain
- Opening invocation (1–2 paragraphs, ends with refrain)
- Subhead #1: Natural Image → Personal Life
- Subhead #2: Reflection & Resolution  
- Subhead #3: Closing Movement (echoes refrain)

**Word count target:** 900–1,200 words

**Refrain rules:** Introduced at end of opening invocation, echoed at close. Can shift subtly in wording between appearances. Should be evocative, ~12 words or fewer.

**Midjourney prompt template:**
```
an abstract impressionist painting of a full moon over the columbia river, [subject], impasto, blue and beige, [composition], visible brush marks, night, vancouver washington --ar 16:9
```
- `[subject]` = main subject described succinctly
- `[composition]` = what's in the image and how it's framed

**Facebook post rules:** First-person. Short. Lead with premise (not the question). End with `Read about it: [URL]` + engagement question. No em dashes. Don't repeat headline phrasing.

**Instagram:** Same as FB + hashtags (4–8, broad and niche mix) + "Link in bio, always."

**Meta description:** 150–160 chars. Lead with reader value. Include primary keyword naturally. End with intrigue if space allows.

**SEO primary keywords used:**
- Cold Moon: "cold moon"
- Wolf Moon: not explicitly confirmed, likely "wolf moon" or "wolf moon meaning"

**AI Tells reference:** Wikipedia's "Signs of AI Writing" — she references this explicitly and has internalized it.

**Punctuation rule (absolute):** NO EM DASHES. Ever. Not in drafts, not in social copy, not in image prompts. This is the hardest rule and the most enforced.

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

**Formatting:**
- No em dashes (stated in every document, enforced in practice)
- No bullet points in her prose — she writes in flowing sentences
- Italics for emphasis or internal thought, used sparingly
- Sentence case for subheadlines
- Title case for post titles

**Voice:**
- Lyrical long sentences with embedded sensory detail, interrupted by short punchy truths
- Conversational disruptions ("Me? I question everything.")
- First-person throughout
- No "underscore," "tapestry," "multifaceted," "delve," "vibrant," "pivotal," "foster," "cultivate," "leverage" — the full AI vocabulary blacklist

**What she responds well to:**
- Specific praise tied to specific lines
- Questions that draw out what she already knows
- Options presented without judgment
- Collaborative iteration without pressure to finalize early

**What she finds unhelpful:**
- AI vocabulary patterns (she will catch them)
- Generic praise ("good imagery")
- Negative parallelisms ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Promotional enthusiasm / importance inflation
- Anthropomorphizing her crows as wise teachers — they're just crows doing crow things, and *she* draws the parallel

**Aesthetic sensibilities:**
- Grounded lyricism, not purple prose
- Earned vulnerability, not performed emotion
- The specific over the general (names, textures, actual events)
- Crows are a recurring touchstone, not a metaphor she's tired of — but she handles them carefully

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

**Pete:** Her husband. Present in the blog through domestic details — staying in bed later with him during winter, his presence in the floating home. Not a central character but a grounding presence. [INFERRED] She writes *around* him rather than *about* him.

**The crows:** Named regulars include Robber (bold, food-grabbing) and Shy. She feeds them from the "crow bar" — a shelf on the upper deck of her floating home. Winter routine means later arrivals (later sunrise). Food choices shift with weather: peanuts in shells are "waterproof," bread dissolves in rain. The crows' behavior through the year tracked her own emotional seasons in the series.

**Intel:** Fifteen years of corporate employment ended with her layoff in July 2025. The layoff is a central fact of the year. She doesn't express bitterness about Intel specifically, but the event was seismic.

**Lingua Ink:** Her publishing company. Separate voice/brand from her personal blog. The business building post-layoff was the primary financial focus of the year — and a source of significant guilt when creativity took over.

**Anonymous corporate job opportunity:** In November/December 2025, a former colleague recommended her for a position. She interviewed and didn't get it. Her reaction was complex — initially disappointed, then relieved. This shaped the Cold Moon and Wolf Moon posts significantly.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

**AI tells in drafts.** This was the persistent struggle. Claude's initial drafts for Cold Moon contained multiple AI markers that Maya caught: negative parallelisms, anaphora, staccato parallel structures, uniform sentence rhythm. The revision process was substantial. Even after passes, she found patterns to fix.

**The tension between the blog's poetic ritual and her actual life.** The series was conceived as a year-long project. By December/January, she was also genuinely weighing a return to corporate work. Writing authentically about the tension between creativity and financial necessity, without making it either a neat resolution or a pity spiral, was the craft challenge of the final posts.

**The guilt thread.** The Wolf Moon post required finding the word for what she'd been carrying all year: not just financial anxiety, but *guilt* — for being laid off, for creating instead of earning, for spending time on entrepreneurship when income was needed. Finding that word unlocked the finale. [INFERRED] This may still be unresolved emotionally even if the post resolved it narratively.

**The "anthropomorphizing the crows" trap.** In earlier drafts, crows were positioned as wise or instructive. Maya pushes back on this — they're not teachers, they're animals. She draws the lesson; the crows just do what crows do.

**Painting studio.** She set up a studio in her dining room during this period — returning to painting as a creative practice explicitly *not* monetized. This was thematically important to the Wolf Moon post (creativity as resistance to productivity guilt) but also [INFERRED] practically complicated — dining room becomes studio means some domestic disruption she and Pete are navigating.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Decision: Wolf Moon as series finale**
The question of whether to continue the series into a second year was live during the November/December work. By the time we reached Wolf Moon brainstorming, Maya had decided the January post would conclude the cycle. Rationale: the series had traced a complete year and arrived at a genuine emotional conclusion. Forcing a second year risked diluting what the first achieved. Also practical: her life circumstances were changing (potential return to employment), making monthly ritual writing uncertain.

**Decision: "Hungry and surviving, I'm here" as Wolf Moon refrain**
Several refrain options were explored. This one won because it held multiple simultaneous meanings: literal hunger (financial), creative hunger, the hunger to simply exist and be present without justification. The wolf howl framing — not hunting, just announcing presence — gave the refrain its spine.

**Decision: Wolf Moon structured around guilt, not just hardship**
Early brainstorm positioned the finale around surviving financial lean times. Maya pushed deeper: the real story was surviving the *guilt* that accompanied every creative choice. This reframe gave the post its distinctiveness and its emotional truth.

**Decision: Three acts — "What the Year Devoured," "What Survived," "The Howl"**
The subhead choices encoded the narrative arc cleanly. "Devoured" for the loss. "Survived" for what remained after. "The Howl" for the declaration at the end — not resolution exactly, but presence.

**Decision: Cold Moon refrain "Even the crows sleep later in winter"**
This emerged from the actual observation that crows arrive later in winter (later sunrise). The specificity made it land — it's not a metaphor imported from outside, it's something Maya actually observes from her crow bar. That earned quality was the deciding factor.

**Decision: Facebook copy leads with topic, not atmosphere**
In earlier social drafts, the FB post opened with something evocative/atmospheric. Maya edited it to lead with the concrete topic first — what the post is *about* — because Facebook truncates quickly and readers need to know the premise immediately. This preference carries to all FB posts.

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

**Read the project documents first.** There are five: Style Guide, Structure Guide, AI Tells Guide, Blog Writing Process, and When the Draft is Final. They're in the project files. The Blog Writing Process document tells you the exact sequence to follow. Don't skip steps.

**The AI Tells review is not optional and not a formality.** Do it rigorously. Then do it again. Maya will find what you missed. The specific patterns to hunt: negative parallelisms, em dashes (absolute ban), anaphora, uniform paragraph length, tailing -ing clauses, importance inflation, the vocabulary blacklist.

**Let her find the emotional truth before you build structure.** Don't offer an outline until she's said something like "I think it's really about X." That moment is the brainstorm's purpose. Hold space for it.

**Her edits are the most accurate signal you have.** When she rewrites a line herself, study it. That's her voice in its purest form. Use it to calibrate everything else.

**The crows are not metaphors she's tired of, but she handles them carefully.** Don't make them wise or instructive. They're just crows. She draws her own parallel.

**The refrain can shift slightly from opening to close.** The Structure Guide says so. Don't insist on verbatim repetition if a small variation serves the arc better.

**She's navigating reentry into corporate work.** This is emotionally complex. She's not defeated by it, but she's not simple about it either. The blog has been a space for processing this tension. Don't flatten it into either triumph or tragedy.

**Lingua Ink ≠ Maya Bairey blog voice.** If she asks you to write something for Lingua Ink, ask for clarification on tone before defaulting to her personal voice.

**When she says the draft is final, follow the 'When the Draft is Final' doc step by step, one item at a time, waiting for approval before proceeding.** This is the workflow she built. Don't batch the deliverables.

**Her floating home on the Columbia River in Portland, Oregon is a constant in her writing.** The river, the crow bar on the upper deck, the rocking, the sound of water — these are always available as grounding details. Use them when they fit; don't force them when they don't.

**[INFERRED] She's in a tender place creatively.** The year-long series is over. She may be returning to employment. The painting studio is new. Be collaborative and supportive without being sycophantic — she doesn't need reassurance, she needs a good working partner.
