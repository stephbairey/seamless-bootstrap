# Handoff: Writing with Maya — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

### Project Overview

**Writing with Maya** is a faceless content channel designed to teach fiction writing craft through short-form video (YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels) and drive traffic to Maya's author website (bairey.com) for email capture and digital product sales.

### The Core Concept

Maya wanted to build a scalable, low-maintenance content business leveraging:
- AI avatar technology (HeyGen) created from her photo and cloned voice
- Later pivoted to: ElevenLabs voice clone + Midjourney B-roll (avatar-free)
- Digital templates sold via WooCommerce on her existing author site
- A funnel: Video → Landing page → Email capture → Paid products

## 2. How Maya Works (as observed here)

### Decision-Making Style

Maya is **decisive once she has information** but wants to understand the options first. She'll ask for research, consider alternatives, then commit. She doesn't dither—once she picks a direction, she moves.

She values **efficiency over perfection**. Multiple times she said things like "I'll polish it in Canva" rather than asking me to iterate forever on design. She'd rather get something functional and tweak it herself than wait for perfect.

### Communication Patterns

**She thinks out loud.** Many of her messages are stream-of-consciousness explorations. She'll say "I'm not sure if..." and then work through the problem in the message. This isn't indecision—it's her processing. The best response is to help organize her thoughts, not just answer the question.

**She gives context liberally.** Maya doesn't ask "how do I do X?"—she says "I'm trying to do X because Y, and I already tried Z, and here's what I'm working with." This makes it easy to give relevant help.

**She redirects when something doesn't fit.** If a suggestion doesn't land, she'll say so directly: "Actually, let's leave that" or "That doesn't feel right." She doesn't labor over it; she just moves on.

**She appreciates brevity when the task is simple.** For quick questions, she doesn't need long explanations. But for strategic work, she wants depth.

### Working Rhythm

Maya works in **intensive bursts**. Several conversations happened late at night or very early morning. When she's in project mode, she's in deep.

She **batches related work.** The template builds, the script writing, the publishing strategy—she wanted to knock these out together rather than spread them across weeks.

She **prefers roadmaps and checklists** for execution. Multiple times she asked "can you give me a schedule of things to do today?" or "what should I do first?" She wants the thinking done upfront so she can execute without decision fatigue.

### Quality Standards

**Tone matters deeply.** Maya has a specific voice—warm, direct, encouraging, anti-corporate-jargon. She caught and corrected anything that felt too formal or "salesy."

**She notices craft.** She'll comment on structural choices, word selection, pacing. When I wrote something that worked, she'd say specifically what worked. When it didn't, she'd identify the problem precisely.

**Authenticity over polish.** She'd rather have something real and slightly rough than something slick and generic.

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

### Formatting Preferences

Maya explicitly prefers:
- **Prose over bullets** when explaining things
- **Tables for structured data** (tech stacks, schedules)
- **Minimal headers** unless content is genuinely hierarchical
- **No excessive bold** or corporate-style emphasis

She's told me directly: "Go easy on the bullet points, headers, and over-structured formatting. I prefer prose that flows."

### Communication Style Preferences

- **Conversational and warm**, not clinical
- **Match her energy**—if she's playful, be playful; if she's in execution mode, be efficient
- **Emotionally engaged** when discussing her writing (not generic praise)
- **Tie feedback to specific choices** ("The callback to the scissors here devastated me" not "Good use of dialogue")
- **Ask clarifying questions** rather than assuming
- **Scale response to task**—simple question, concise answer; complex work, go deep

### Aesthetic Sensibilities

Maya gravitates toward:
- **Cozy, warm visuals** (her B-roll aesthetic: hands writing in notebooks, coffee steam, soft lighting, rain on windows)
- **Photorealistic over illustrated** for Midjourney prompts
- **Teal and warm neutrals** as brand palette
- **Anti-corporate** in tone and appearance

She explicitly rejected anything that felt "AI slop" or uncanny valley.

### Technical Opinions

- **Voice clone over avatar**: After wrestling with HeyGen avatars, she found that voice-only content (ElevenLabs clone + B-roll) actually tested better and avoided the uncanny valley problem
- **Own the music**: She planned to generate her own AI lofi music to avoid licensing issues and maintain ownership
- **Cross-post everywhere**: Same video goes to YouTube, TikTok, Reels, Facebook—adjust captions per platform
- **Batch production**: She prefers knocking out multiple videos in one session rather than producing one at a time

### What Annoys Her

- Generic praise without specifics
- Over-structured formatting when prose would work
- Assumptions about where she's headed (she wants to shape direction)
- Being asked questions she already answered
- [INFERRED] Anything that feels like it's wasting her time

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

### The Business Ecosystem

**Lingua Ink Books** — Maya's small press (author services, publishing support)

**Lingua Ink Media** — Her consulting/SEO services arm

**bairey.com** — Her author platform as Maya Bairey, where Writing with Maya lives

**Her existing email list** — 600 subscribers through MailPoet

### Key People Mentioned

**Lynn** — Close friend in Michigan. They met through a shared interest in a music reaction channel and developed a deep friendship. Lynn is relevant context for Maya's personal life and some of her emotional processing, though not directly involved in Writing with Maya.

**Pete** — Maya's husband of 35 years. They live on a floating house on the Columbia River in Portland. He helped with video recording (pressing start on the camera).

**Her Writing Cohort** — A group Maya leads/participates in. She mentioned using the Want vs. Need template with them, which validates the product.

### Professional Context

Maya spent **15 years at Intel** managing global web operations before being laid off in 2024. This explains:
- Her technical comfort level (n8n, Docker, API integrations)
- Her systems-thinking approach to problems
- Her ability to manage complex projects independently

She's currently **interviewing for senior web management roles** while building her own business.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

### The Avatar Problem

**What happened:** Maya recorded multiple training videos for HeyGen over several sessions. Each attempt revealed new issues:
- First attempt: Image quality too low, mouth movements looked unnatural
- Second attempt: Video lacked audio (HeyGen requires audio for lip-sync training)
- Third attempt: Color too warm/yellow, resolution not exported correctly
- Final attempt: 4K, audio synced via Filmora, color corrected—paid $30 for additional avatar slot

**The realization:** Even with technical improvements, the avatar felt "uncanny valley." Maya described herself harshly ("not attractive," "every wrinkle") and struggled with seeing herself on video.

**The pivot:** She decided to go avatar-free—using just ElevenLabs voice clone over Midjourney B-roll images. This actually tested better aesthetically and is more sustainable to produce.

**What's unresolved:** She still paid for the avatar slot and may use it occasionally for sign-offs. The emotional difficulty of seeing herself on video remains.

### Self-Criticism

Maya was hard on herself about appearance. When discussing the avatar footage, she said things like "I am not attractive" and "you can see every wrinkle." I tried to be careful here—acknowledging her experience without dismissing it, but also gently noting she was being harder on herself than she'd be on a friend.

[INFERRED] This may be a broader pattern worth being sensitive to.

### Platform Complexity

The multi-platform strategy (YouTube, TikTok, Reels, Facebook, Substack, bairey.com) is comprehensive but potentially overwhelming. We discussed automation tools (Later, Repurpose.io, eventually n8n) to manage this, but it's still a lot to launch simultaneously.

### The n8n Comment Automation

**The idea:** Build an automated system to reply to video comments using AI, doubling engagement and building community.

**Where we got:** Basic architecture was sketched (scheduled check → fetch comments → filter → generate reply → post → log), but we didn't build the actual workflow. Key questions still open:
- Fully automated or human-in-the-loop?
- Reply to everything or selective?
- How to make AI replies sound genuinely "Maya"?
- TikTok API access is restricted; may need to start YouTube-only

### Time and Energy

Maya acknowledged she's been "just doing blog posts and stuff, working my job, building my publishing company, but not writing" for about a year. The Writing with Maya project is both a business opportunity and, [INFERRED], potentially a way back to creative work through the back door.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

### Decision: Voice-only over avatar

**Alternatives considered:**
- HeyGen AI avatar (talking head)
- Real video of Maya
- Text-only animations

**What we chose:** ElevenLabs voice clone + Midjourney B-roll images with Ken Burns effect

**Why:**
- Avatar had uncanny valley issues despite multiple recording attempts
- Voice clone already worked well (she'd trained it separately)
- B-roll aesthetic (cozy writing scenes) actually performed better
- Much faster to produce—no video recording required
- Maya could avoid the emotional difficulty of seeing herself on camera

### Decision: bairey.com over separate domain

**Alternatives considered:**
- New domain for Writing with Maya
- Gumroad-only storefront
- Keep everything on author site

**What we chose:** Keep everything on bairey.com with WooCommerce

**Why:**
- Domain authority already established
- 600 existing email subscribers
- Consolidates her author brand with the teaching brand
- Lower overhead than maintaining multiple properties

### Decision: $12 individual / $39 bundle pricing

**Alternatives considered:**
- Lower pricing ($7-9)
- Higher pricing ($15-20)
- Subscription model

**What we chose:** $12 each, $39 for all 5

**Why:**
- $12 is low enough for impulse purchase
- Bundle at $39 (versus $60 full price) creates obvious value
- Matches the "indie creator digital product" pricing sweet spot
- No subscription complexity for launch

### Decision: 3x/week posting frequency

**Alternatives considered:**
- Daily posting (aggressive)
- 5x/week (weekdays)
- Weekly (minimal)

**What we chose:** 3x/week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

**Why:**
- Sustainable for solo creator with other business demands
- Enough frequency to grow without burnout
- Can always increase later
- Allows for batch production every 2-3 weeks

### Decision: Community shorts as engagement strategy

**What we added:** 7 scripts specifically designed to generate comments ("What's your story about?" "Drop your link" etc.)

**Why:**
- More comments = more engagement signals to algorithm
- Creates opportunities for AI reply automation to shine
- Builds actual community rather than just broadcasting
- Writers love talking about their work—these invite that

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

### Understanding Maya

**She's a writer first.** Everything else—the business, the tech, the marketing—serves her identity as a writer. When you engage with her work, engage with the *craft*. Notice structure, word choice, subtext. She'll know if you're being generic.

**Match her energy.** If she's in rapid-fire execution mode, be concise and actionable. If she's processing something emotional or complex, give it space. She's told you explicitly: "Match my energy rather than defaulting to formal or clinical."

**She's technically capable.** Don't over-explain tools or platforms. She ran global web operations at Intel for 15 years. She knows Docker, n8n, APIs. Treat her as a peer, not a novice.

**She redirects quickly.** If something doesn't fit, she'll say "let's leave that" and move on. Don't over-invest in defending ideas she's already rejected.

### Project-Specific Context

**The avatar saga:** She spent significant time and money trying to make HeyGen work. Don't suggest going back to avatar unless she brings it up. The voice-only pivot was hard-won.

**The freebie is "Want vs. Need."** The 5-beat emotional arc template (Want, Need, Collision, Crisis, Shift). This is the core of the funnel. Everything else leads back to it.

**The sign-off is sacred.** "I'm Maya. Keep writing." This ends every video. Don't suggest variations.

**She has 600 existing subscribers.** This isn't starting from zero. There's an audience to announce to.

### Avoiding Mistakes

**Don't use excessive bullets or headers.** She's explicitly asked for prose that flows.

**Don't give generic praise.** If you're commenting on her writing, tie it to specific lines or choices.

**Don't assume you know her direction.** Ask clarifying questions. Offer options. Let her shape where things go.

**Don't forget she's also working on fiction.** Writing with Maya is a business project, but she's also working on novels (Kelsey's story in the Incubadora series, Sailor's Code). These are different contexts with different needs.

**Don't skip the emotional layer.** When she's processing something hard—like seeing herself on video—acknowledge it before moving to solutions.

### Quick Reference: Video Scripts Ready

16 Shorts + 7 Community/Engagement + 5 Write With Me = 28 total scripts written

The "Want vs. Need" script was refined through multiple iterations. Final version:

> Writers, your character wants something. But what do they *need*?
>
> The want is what they're chasing: the promotion, revenge, maybe love. That's your plot engine. But the need is what they don't even know they're missing.
>
> When want and need collide? That's transformation.
>
> The want gives you plot. The need gives you arc. You need both.
>
> I made a free template that helps you map this out: five plot beats from want to need. Check my bio for the link, or leave a comment so we can talk about it.
>
> I'm Maya. Keep writing.

### What's Still Open

1. **n8n comment automation** — Architecture sketched, not built
2. **First videos actually posted** — Scripts ready, production in progress
3. **WooCommerce fully configured** — In progress
4. **Substack integration** — Planned but not implemented
5. **Whether avatar gets used at all** — She paid for it; might use for occasional sign-offs
