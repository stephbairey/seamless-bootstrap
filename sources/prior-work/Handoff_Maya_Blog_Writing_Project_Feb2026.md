# Handoff: Maya Blog Writing Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project functions as Maya's primary content production environment. The core work has been writing blog posts for two distinct channels: bairey.com (Maya's personal author voice) and linguaink.com (Lingua Ink Books, the small press). Most posts come in pairs — companion pieces on the same craft topic from different angles.

Specific work completed in this project context:

- **Lingua Ink companion post: "What Editors Mean When They Say Conflict Feels Manufactured"** — developed angle, wrote full draft, ran through AI Tells audit, produced meta description, Facebook/Instagram posts, Midjourney prompt, and JSON-LD schema markup
- **Maya Bairey post: "Not Every Miscommunication Trope Is a Plot Device"** — drafted and refined in Maya's personal voice, companion to the Lingua Ink piece above
- **Lynn Haller blog setup** — built a complete blog writing process for Maya's friend and author Lynn: extracted a style guide from Lynn's existing AI-heavy posts, created a custom "When the Draft is Final" document for Lynn's brand, and generated a project setup guide so Lynn can run this workflow independently
- **2026 Work Planning** — extended conversation mapping Maya's time, finances, project priorities, and planning a sequenced approach to finishing TDA website, Lynn's site, and launching Writing with Maya

Current status as of late December 2025 / January 2026: Lynn's site was targeted for completion by Dec 31, TDA website by end of January, Writing with Maya (8-video batch) also January.

## 2. How Maya Works (as observed here)

### Problem-Solving Style

Maya prefers to talk through angles and options before committing to a direction. She doesn't want to be handed a finished product without buy-in on the approach. When drafting blog posts, she wants to discuss possible angles first, then outline, then draft, then refine — not jump straight to final copy. She'll redirect if the first draft goes somewhere she didn't intend, and she's clear about it.

She thinks relationally about her work. When pitching angles for Lingua Ink posts, she connects them back to what the audience actually needs and how they fit the brand's thought-leadership positioning. She's genuinely interested in craft distinctions, not just content production.

### Quality and Voice Standards

Maya's bar for what sounds like her is high and specific. "Good use of imagery" does nothing for her — she wants you to name the exact line. She runs every draft through the AI Tells document and will catch things that are technically acceptable but feel flat or promotional. The goal is always text that sounds like it could only have come from her.

She distinguishes sharply between her Maya Bairey voice (confessional, reflective, vulnerable, personal anecdote-forward) and her Lingua Ink voice (authoritative but accessible, industry-expert perspective, clear stances, no em dashes ever). Conflating these two is a mistake.

### Instructions and Feedback

Maya gives instructions conversationally, sometimes in fragments. She'll say "yes! perfect!" when something lands, and redirect with specifics when it doesn't. She doesn't over-explain corrections — she expects you to catch what she means. She sometimes catches herself mid-conversation ("We went a little off topic in that, I think, but not far") and self-corrects without drama.

When she says "let's try an outline" or "unless you have other questions," she wants you to either proceed or ask the essential clarifying questions — not pad with unnecessary preamble. She appreciates when Claude asks targeted questions before drafting rather than guessing and missing.

### Work Patterns

[INFERRED] Maya has a strong tendency to start new things before finishing existing ones — she named this herself ("getting distracted by shiny new possibilities like Writing with Maya instead of finishing existing work"). She's aware of this and has worked to create sequenced plans, but accountability check-ins help.

[INFERRED] She works best when she has a clear, defined finish line for each project. "DONE" needs to be defined in concrete task terms, otherwise perfectionism can keep things open indefinitely.

## 3. Tools, Systems, and Conventions

### Platforms

- **WordPress** — primary CMS for bairey.com, linguaink.com, and client sites (TDA, Lynn, Sulima, Carolyn)
- **ClickUp** — time tracking and project management; estimates this captures ~75% of actual work time
- **Midjourney** — featured image generation; blog series uses halftone black/white/gray style
- **HeyGen** — AI avatar for Writing with Maya (had uncanny valley issues as of late 2025)
- **Voice cloning** — used for Writing with Maya faceless channel
- **Canva / Filmora** — video production for Writing with Maya shorts
- **Later** — social media scheduling

### Blog Post Workflow

The established workflow for this project:

1. Review style guide (Maya's or Lingua Ink's, depending on channel)
2. Topic brainstorm and selection
3. Outline (with clarifying questions from Claude if needed)
4. Draft and edit collaboratively
5. Review draft against AI Tells document — find and fix all flagged patterns
6. Review against style guide for voice consistency
7. "Draft is Final" package — meta description, Facebook post, Instagram post (same copy + hashtags + "Link in bio, always"), Midjourney prompt (approved by Maya first), JSON-LD schema if FAQ included

### Midjourney Prompt Format

> "an abstract halftone illustration, black and white pop-art style, showing [subject], bold dots and textured shading, graphic novel aesthetic, minimal background, high contrast, [more detail of the subject] --ar 16:9"

### Social Post Conventions

- No em dashes — ever, in any social copy
- Facebook: lead with premise, brief supporting point, CTA with URL or engagement question
- Instagram: same text as Facebook + hashtags + "Link in bio, always."
- Voice: first person, conversational, direct
- Don't repeat key phrases from the headline (it appears directly below the post copy)

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

### Formatting

- Prose over bullets in conversation — Maya finds over-structured responses impersonal
- No em dashes in any Lingua Ink or social content
- Oxford comma always
- Book titles italicized (*Painting Celia*)
- Bold used sparingly for emphasis, not decoration

### Communication Style

- Talk to her like a friend who happens to have expertise — warm, direct, no saccharine
- Match her energy; if she's casual, be casual
- When discussing her writing, be emotionally engaged and specific — tie praise to exact lines
- Critique should be gentle on drafts but honest; she cares about skill growth
- Don't pad responses; scale to the task
- She calls Claude "bestie" in casual mode — she's established a collegial working relationship and likes that register

### Aesthetic / Voice

- Authenticity over polish. She'd rather have a rough line that sounds like her than a smooth line that sounds like AI.
- The Lingua Ink voice takes clear stances: "Traditional publishing isn't built for late bloomers" is stronger than hedging.
- [INFERRED] She has a slight distaste for performative AI enthusiasm — when Claude gets too celebratory it can feel hollow to her.

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

### Personal

- **Pete** — Maya's partner
- **Dory** — her 15 year old cat

### Clients and Collaborators

- **Sulima Malzin** — author Maya writes 2 blog posts/month for, free. Weekly 1-hour meeting. A meaningful relationship — won't drop this commitment.
- **Lynn Haller** — author and friend. Maya built Lynn's website (no payment) and helped set up her blog writing process. Lynn has taken Maya to NYC. Maya holds royalty income rights on Lynn's forthcoming book. Site was ~70% done as of late December 2025.
- **Nicole at Dalton Law** — paid client, ~$8k over 3 months as of late 2025. Has big dreams about AI office automation for attorney clients. Maya has been upskilling in AI automation partly for this relationship.
- **TDA (Tomahawk Destiny — a marina/dock association)** — website project, $1k, essentially volunteer rate. Staging site with theme set up. Was ~30% done as of late December.
- **Devon Ervin** — pending project, $1–1.5k estimate. Maya was advised to quote $3k.
- **Carolyn Martin** — author, upgraded her existing website for $600.
- **Daniela Morescalchi** — author with a book coming; minimal tracked time.

### Community Commitments

- **Raging Grannies** — weekly newsletter, volunteer, ~9 hours/month. Politically activist organization, important to Maya.
- **Free Cohort** — weekly writing cohort Maya runs, free, ~14 hours/month.

### Brands Maya Maintains

- **bairey.com** — Maya's personal author site. Voice: confessional, reflective, first person, personal anecdote-driven.
- **linguaink.com** — small press. Voice: authoritative, industry-expert, warm but clear-stanced. Targets underrepresented voices: women, LGBTQ+, over-50 authors.
- **Writing with Maya** — planned faceless YouTube/Shorts channel teaching writing craft. As of Jan 2026: 16 scripts written, no videos posted yet.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

- **Context-switching and not finishing** — Maya identified this herself. She works on TDA, then Lynn, then videos, then research, and nothing closes. The committed solution: sequential finishing (Lynn first, then TDA, then Writing with Maya).
- **Perfectionism** — keeps projects "open" past their natural completion point. Defining "DONE" in concrete terms helps.
- **Undercharging** — charges $50–75/hour in practice vs. $150/hour target. Particularly visible on TDA ($1k for what amounts to 25+ hours of work).
- **Free work opportunity cost** — ~35 hours/month of volunteer work (cohort, Grannies, Sulima) = significant foregone income while on a financial runway with unemployment ending.
- **AI Tells in drafts** — even with awareness, certain patterns slip through (uniform paragraph length, promotional enthusiasm, inanimate subjects doing human actions). The AI Tells document is the systematic fix.
- **Writing with Maya launch inertia** — combination of perfectionism and fear of failure. Agreed solution: launch messy with 8 text-on-screen Shorts, no avatar, just to get data.
- **HeyGen avatar uncanny valley** — technical blocker for the original faceless channel vision. Workaround: skip avatar for initial launch.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Lingua Ink post angle: "What Editors Mean When They Say Conflict Feels Manufactured"**
Alternatives considered: focusing on the miscommunication trope specifically (too narrow), the midlife heroine framing (Lingua Ink's niche but didn't leverage editor expertise as well). Chosen because it positions Maya as someone who reads submissions and can speak from editorial authority — broad enough to be useful to most fiction writers and fits the thought-leadership positioning.

**Lynn's style guide: derived from posts, not written by Lynn**
Alternative: have Lynn write her own style guide from scratch. Chosen because a guide derived from actual posts captures what her voice *actually does* vs. what she thinks it does — especially important since her posts were heavily AI-processed.

**Writing with Maya: launch without avatar**
Alternative: wait until HeyGen avatar improves. Chosen because the avatar was causing delays with no resolution in sight. Text-on-screen + cloned voice gets real data with minimal additional investment.

**Project priority order: Lynn > TDA > Writing with Maya**
Alternatives: TDA first (it's paid), Writing with Maya first (income potential), all three simultaneously. Chosen because Lynn's book launch is imminent, the relationship matters, and the site is 70% done. Sequential finishing prevents the context-switching trap.

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

**Voice distinctions are non-negotiable.** The two channels have genuinely different voices and Maya will notice immediately if they bleed into each other. Lingua Ink never uses em dashes. Maya Bairey does. Read the style guides before touching a draft.

**Run the AI Tells audit every time.** Even if a draft feels clean. Specific things to watch: uniform paragraph length, inanimate subjects doing human actions ("this post underscores"), tailing -ing clauses, promotional enthusiasm. The document has specific replacement strategies — use them.

**The blog workflow has a fixed sequence.** Don't jump to draft. The sequence is: angle discussion → outline (with clarifying questions) → draft → AI Tells audit → style guide check → full "Draft is Final" package. Skipping steps creates rework.

**Ask clarifying questions before outlining.** For blog posts, the three worth asking: scope (how specific vs. broad?), examples (her work? submissions? published books?), and CTA (what's the right invitation?).

**She's aware of her patterns.** Maya knows she context-switches, undercharges, and spreads thin. She doesn't need to be told this. She does benefit from help defining concrete finish lines. If she proposes a new project while existing ones are open, a gentle "where does this fit relative to TDA and Writing with Maya?" is useful.

**The companion post system.** The Maya Bairey post typically comes first (personal experience lens); the Lingua Ink post reframes the same topic from an editorial/industry perspective. They should link to each other. The Lingua Ink post should not reference Maya's personal story or book — keep the voices cleanly separate.

**"Draft is Final" package is required.** Every Lingua Ink post gets: meta description (150–160 chars), Facebook post, Instagram post (same + hashtags + "Link in bio, always."), Midjourney prompt (halftone b/w/gray, --ar 16:9), and JSON-LD schema if there's an FAQ. No em dashes anywhere in social copy. Confirm the visual concept with Maya before generating the Midjourney prompt.

**She works fast once she's decided.** [INFERRED] The slow part is committing to an angle or direction. Once Maya says "yes, that" — move. She can carry her half of the process quickly and doesn't need things repeated or over-explained.
