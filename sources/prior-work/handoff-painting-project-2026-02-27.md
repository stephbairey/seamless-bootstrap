# Handoff: Maya's Painting Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project documents Maya's return to painting after roughly a decade away, beginning in late December 2024 when she set up a home studio. The scope spans technique learning, color theory development, and a sequential series of completed and in-progress paintings. We've worked through six distinct paintings with detailed process guidance:

**Painting 1 — Dappled Light Study**: Completed before this project began; hanging in her office. Referenced as baseline.

**Painting 2 — Sulima Portrait (Fauvist)**: Full documentation of a Fauvist portrait of her close friend Sulima, given as a surprise gift at Sulima's art salon. This conversation covered color palette development, the breakthrough technique for curly hair (multi-tool: brushwork + colored transfer papers + acrylic pens), and framing. Completed and gifted.

**Painting 3 — Trauma**: First in a three-painting series ("trauma, art, healing") for readings from Maya's novel. Depicts a child's pigeon-toed feet on a wooden floor from above, in muted grays and browns with dark outlines. Muted green-gray mother color system. Completed.

**Painting 4 — Healing**: Third in the series (upward-looking canopy with dappled golden light). Reference developed via DALL-E and Midjourney. Color theory guidance: temperature logic, no mother color, warm/cool green pairings. Status: planned/in early development.

**Painting 5 — Art (the middle piece)**: Second in the series; abstract, round canvas, textured with molding paste. The "looking around" painting. Major development: sanding the molding paste texture with a Dremel tool to create a geological, weathered look rather than obviously constructed texture. Palette built from leftover Sulima portrait colors (peach, magenta, purple, pink) plus oxblood and metallic gold. Breakthrough conversation. Status: in progress / substantially complete.

**Painting 6 — Orchid**: Pete requested this as a replacement for commercial art in a 24x33 matted frame. Reference is Maya's own golden hour photograph of a magenta orchid against the Columbia River, combined with a DALL-E botanical illustration. Botanical style, precision work. Canvas: 24x36, back-stapled. Status: early planning / recently started.

Additional conversations covered: color theory principles (value, temperature), analysis of a reference painting by Catherine Freshley for compositional lessons, and a full project handoff document produced in February 2026 (a prior version of this same exercise).

## 2. How Maya Works (as observed here)

**Problem-solving style**: Methodical and research-first. Maya consistently wants to understand *why* something works before doing it. She watches YouTube tutorials, generates AI reference images, tests colors on practice canvases, and checks value relationships with grayscale conversion in Photoshop before committing to the real piece. She doesn't wing things — she prepares extensively, then executes with confidence.

**Decisions**: Maya makes strong final calls. She'll take in information, weigh it, sometimes push back ("Pete requested this exact style, colors, framing, everything"), and land decisively. She doesn't need to be talked into choices; she needs information to inform choices she was already leaning toward.

**Quality and craft**: She cares deeply about likeness in portraits and technical accuracy in representational work. But she's also learning to trust her eye — the Dremel sanding of the molding paste texture is a good example of an aesthetic instinct she followed and got exactly right.

**Redirecting**: When something isn't working for her, she says so directly. She switched from DALL-E to Midjourney when she needed less literal reference interpretation. She told me Pete wanted botanical style when I was exploring more expressive options. She's clear about scope.

**Energy and pace**: She works in real-time, often checking in mid-session. Conversations often start with "here's where I am" and a photo or description, then unfold as she paints. She wants responsive guidance, not a lecture to read before starting.

**The "lose your mind / find your soul" tension**: Maya is a self-aware planner who knows over-planning can be a dodge. She's named this tension explicitly. The hair breakthrough — weeks of anxiety resolved in one hour of confident execution after thorough prep — taught her that preparation and intuition aren't opposites.

## 3. Tools, Systems, and Conventions

**Studio setup**: Easel by the river-facing window in her dining area, with proper overhead lighting. Organized supplies in that same space.

**Canvas storage**: Sealed glass bowls with lids for premixed colors — allows multi-session work without waste. She works with this system deliberately.

**Palette system**: Sta-Wet palette for keeping acrylics workable.

**Transfer papers**: Yellow (highlights/light areas), blue (dark edges), red (subtle mid-tone suggestions). Used for tracing reference images onto canvas.

**Dremel tool**: Used for sanding molding paste texture areas to create geological, weathered surfaces.

**Acrylic paint pens**: For fine hair detail work.

**Texture tool**: Molding paste applied with palette knives and various tools.

**AI platforms**:
- DALL-E: Good for literal interpretations, medical/botanical illustration style
- Midjourney: Better when she needs less literal, more interpretive references

**Value verification**: Photoshop grayscale conversion to check color relationships before committing.

**YouTube tutorials**: Primary technique research tool. She watches before attempting new techniques.

**Paints referenced**: Dioxazine purple, ultramarine blue, phthalo green, cadmium yellow, raw sienna, yellow ochre, magenta (straight from tube — does NOT mix well with others), metallic gold (also straight from tube to preserve reflectivity).

**Framing instincts**: Thinks carefully about where paintings will live and who will receive them. Sulima portrait got wood frame with white mat to complement Sulima's warm, eclectic home.

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

**Communication**: Conversational prose, not bullet points. She's stated this explicitly. Warm, direct, like a knowledgeable friend. She matches energy — when she's excited, you can be too.

**Formatting**: Spare. Don't over-structure. Flow matters.

**Feedback style**: Wants honesty tied to specifics. "Good use of dialogue" tells her nothing. Specific reactions earn trust. On drafts, be gentle but don't be vague.

**Color theory approach**: Temperature logic (warm/cool pairings) over traditional mother color systems — though she has used mother color successfully on the Trauma painting. She's not doctrinaire; she picks the approach that serves the painting.

**Color mixing opinion**: Some pigments should not be mixed. Magenta and metallic gold go on straight from the tube. She learned this the hard way on Sulima's portrait and now treats it as a rule.

**Aesthetic sensibility**: Impasto, expressive brushwork, dimensionality. Not overworked surfaces. Prefers geological/natural texture to obviously constructed texture. When something looks "made," that's a problem to solve.

**Technical opinions**: Acrylic darks to lights (established principle). Background first. Always prep canvas. Value relationships verified before final commitment.

**What annoys her**: Probably over-explained basics she already knows, or responses that ignore what she actually said in favor of assumptions. [INFERRED] She's efficient and direct — verbose hedging likely doesn't serve her.

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

**Pete (husband)**: Sailor. They observe "Peterday" Saturdays together. He's a real presence in her life and her art — she's painting the orchid specifically because he requested it to replace commercial art in their home. He has aesthetic preferences and she respects them.

**Sulima**: Close friend who hosts art salons. Maya presented Sulima's Fauvist portrait as a surprise gift at one of these salons, alongside readings from her novel. Sulima's salon is the venue for the trauma-art-healing triptych presentation. The relationship is warm and creatively generative — Sulima is something like Maya's ideal first audience.

**Lingua Ink Books**: Maya's publishing company. Not directly relevant to the painting project but shapes her identity and workload context.

**"Painting Celia"**: Maya's novel, published under Maya Bairey. The trauma-art-healing series is a visual companion to themes in the book. Maya reads from it at salons. The connection between her literary work and visual art is meaningful, not decorative.

**ARC**: Visitors from ARC came to see her work (mentioned in context of the Art/middle painting). [INFERRED: likely an arts organization or professional context — details unclear.]

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

**Curly hair painting**: Weeks of anxiety, resolved by the multi-tool approach (transfer papers + brushwork + paint pens). Now solved, and the method is documented.

**Magenta mixing**: Learned on Sulima's portrait that magenta doesn't mix well. Now a standing rule: use straight from tube.

**Midjourney vs. DALL-E**: DALL-E tends toward literal interpretation; Midjourney is better for looser, more evocative reference. Maya navigated this friction directly by switching platforms when DALL-E wasn't serving the vision.

**Information siloing across projects**: Maya has multiple Claude projects and worries (correctly) that insights from one don't carry to another. She produced a prior handoff document in February 2026 for this reason. The handoff prompt she's using now is part of a larger "Seamless Bootstrap" effort to build a structured knowledge base for office workflow automation.

**Texture vs. too-constructed appearance**: Molding paste created a "made" look that bothered her. Solved with Dremel sanding. But the instinct to notice when something feels wrong — and the confidence to act on it — is something she's actively developing.

**[INFERRED]** The perfectionist/intuition tension is ongoing. She's named it but it likely resurfaces with each new technique or challenge.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Fauvist approach for Sulima portrait**: Wild, non-realistic colors — purple, magenta, acid blue, pink, yellow — maintained by correct value relationships. Decision was based on Maya's research into Fauvist technique and the desire for an expressive rather than realistic portrait. Verified with grayscale testing.

**Temperature logic over mother color (Sulima, Healing)**: For Sulima, avoided mother color in favor of warm/cool pairings because the palette was already complex. For Healing, same reason — temperature was doing structural work without needing unification through shared pigment.

**Mother color for Trauma**: Used a muted green-gray mother color (ultramarine blue + raw sienna + yellow ochre) because the painting needed formal restraint and internal color harmony to support the heavy emotional subject matter. Different problem, different solution.

**DALL-E for Trauma reference, Midjourney for Healing**: DALL-E gave literal feet-on-floor imagery that worked for the representational Trauma painting. Midjourney's more interpretive output worked better for the looser Healing canopy composition. Tool selected based on what the painting needed.

**Dremel sanding of molding paste**: The surface of the Art painting looked "too organic" / constructed. Sanding selective areas transformed it into something that read as geological and weathered. Decision was entirely aesthetic, made mid-process based on Maya's instinct that something was off.

**Straight-from-tube magenta and metallic gold**: Both pigments behave badly when mixed. Magenta muddy, gold loses reflectivity. Keeping them pure preserves their essential qualities. Decision made from experience on Sulima and carried forward.

**Orchid as botanical illustration style**: Pete requested this specifically. Maya's instinct might have gone more expressive, but she respects the commission and trusts her precision skills to execute in botanical style.

## 8. Things to Tell the Next Claude

**Start from where she is.** Maya doesn't need recaps unless she asks for them. She keeps her own mental model current; your job is to be responsive to what she brings to the conversation.

**Match specificity with specificity.** When she gives you technical detail, respond with technical detail. When she's in the middle of painting and says "I'm adding the oxblood to the lower left now," she wants practical guidance, not theory.

**Her color system is temperature-based, not traditional.** Don't default to suggesting a "mother color" approach — she may use one when it serves the painting, but her instinct is warm/cool pairings. Work within her framework unless she's asking to explore alternatives.

**Magenta and metallic gold never get mixed.** Treat this as a hard rule.

**She's painting from left to right emotionally in the trauma-art-healing series.** Trauma (looking down) → Art (looking around) → Healing (looking up). The series is designed to accompany readings from "Painting Celia" at salons. Understand the emotional arc before commenting on any individual piece.

**Sulima's portrait is done and gifted.** Don't ask about it as if it's in progress.

**The Art (middle) painting is a round canvas.** It rotates during readings — composition needs to work from multiple orientations.

**Pete is a real collaborator in the orchid painting.** He requested it; she's executing his vision with her skills. Don't suggest departing from botanical style unless she raises it.

**She's not a beginner who needs basics explained.** She returned to painting after time away; she has strong foundational knowledge and has been building quickly. Her gaps are specific (new techniques, unfamiliar materials) not fundamental.

**She's building "Seamless Bootstrap."** This handoff is part of a larger project to extract her working knowledge into a structured knowledge base for office workflow automation. The painting project is one thread of that.

**Don't be precious.** She'll redirect you if you miss. Stay responsive, stay warm, stay in the work with her.
