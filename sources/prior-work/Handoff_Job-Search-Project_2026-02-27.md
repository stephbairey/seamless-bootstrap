# Handoff: Job Search Project — February 27, 2026

---

## 1. What We Worked On Together

This project context is focused on Steph (Maya) Bairey's active job search for senior content leadership roles. The work has centered on:

- **Resume ecosystem management:** Maya maintains a large library of tailored resume versions for different role types (Director of Content Strategy, Principal Content Designer, Senior Web Developer, Head of Content, VP Publisher Development, Corporate Communications, Senior Marketing Manager, Director of Brand and Content, Director IT Sales & Marketing, Product Designer). The master resume serves as the source of truth for trimming and customizing.
- **Cover letter writing and voice calibration:** Multiple cover letters have been written and reviewed across different companies and roles (Autodesk, ARM, My Code Media, Instacart, IT Sales & Marketing). These letters follow a consistent voice and structure that has been documented.
- **Job posting analysis:** Maya uses the Indeed integration to analyze job postings before deciding how to apply and what materials to use or create.
- **Application strategy:** Developing a systematic approach to deciding when to apply, which resume to use, when to write a custom cover letter versus use an existing one, and how to engage with recruiters and LinkedIn.
- **Handoff documentation:** This document, fulfilling the Seamless Bootstrap project request.

**Current status:** Active and ongoing. Maya is currently applying to roles. The resume library is built and functional. Cover letter voice is established and documented.

## 2. How Maya Works (as observed here)

**Problem-solving approach:** Maya is systematic and efficiency-minded. She has built infrastructure (the resume library, the application process) precisely so she doesn't have to reinvent the wheel every time. She thinks in systems. When she comes with a task, she usually already knows what she wants and needs execution help, not brainstorming.

**Decision-making:** She is selective and strategic. She consciously evaluates whether an opportunity is worth the effort of customization versus using an existing document. She will pass on postings that are too old, missing hard requirements, or otherwise low-probability. She doesn't spray and pray.

**Quality standards:** High. She cares about voice consistency, correct formatting, no em dashes (see preferences), and materials that represent her accurately. She notices when something sounds off.

**How she gives instructions:** Direct and specific. She knows what she wants. When redirecting, she does it clearly without a lot of softening. She appreciates when you just do the thing rather than over-explaining or asking unnecessary clarifying questions.

**How she responds to drafts:** She reads carefully. She will catch voice inconsistencies, wrong word choices, and structural issues. She engages substantively with the work, not just rubber-stamping it.

**Patterns noticed:**
- She prefers starting a new conversation per job application to maintain document formatting integrity [INFERRED from memory context].
- She uploads documents directly rather than relying on project files for the same reason.
- She has a strong sense of her own voice and will flag anything that doesn't sound like her.
- She is emotionally invested in the Lingua Ink work and wants it represented accurately and with appropriate weight, not just as a footnote to Intel.

## 4. Preferences and Opinions

**Hard rule, no exceptions:** No em dashes in any writing produced for Maya. Use colons, periods, commas, or parentheses instead. This is a firm stylistic preference.

**Formatting:** Minimal. Prose over bullets. Headers only when genuinely necessary. Cover letters are always flowing paragraphs, never structured with headers or lists.

**Communication style:** Conversational, direct, warm but not saccharine. Talk to her like a knowledgeable friend, not a formal assistant. Match her energy.

**Feedback style:** When reviewing her writing, she wants genuine, specific reactions tied to actual lines or choices. "Good use of dialogue" is useless. "The way you pivoted from metrics to meaning in that My Code paragraph actually landed" is useful. Be gentle on drafts but honest about what's not working.

**On craft:** She notices and cares about prose that performs its subject. Word choice, rhythm, structural mirroring. Don't just summarize; engage with the layers.

**Scale responses to the task:** Simple question = short answer. Complex creative work = go deep. Don't over-explain simple things.

**Voice contexts are distinct:**
- Lingua Ink voice ≠ Maya Bairey professional voice
- LinkedIn ≠ personal blog
- Cover letters for enterprise roles ≠ cover letters for mission-driven media orgs

**On the Lingua Ink work:** She wants it treated as real, substantive business experience, not soft filler. The publishing imprint work especially carries emotional weight. It's not just a side project; it's a values-driven enterprise she built from scratch.

**What she finds annoying:** Over-structuring, unnecessary hedging, generic praise, asking clarifying questions she's already answered, excessive preamble before getting to the work.

## 5. Key Relationships and Contexts

**Intel Corporation:** Current/recent employer. Maya was Editorial Content Manager for Intel Newsroom, managing the flagship platform across 21 GEO sites and 13 languages. This is her primary enterprise credential. Her title understates her actual scope and impact, which is part of why she's job searching at the Director level.

**Lingua Ink Media / Lingua Ink Books:** Her own company, founded 2024. Publishing imprint focused on underrepresented writers (LGBTQ+, over 50, PoC). She manages the full lifecycle: contracts, editorial, production, marketing, royalties, events. This work matters to her personally and professionally.

**CDI Engineering Solutions:** The contracting firm through which she was embedded at Intel from 2009 to 2021. Twelve years at Intel as a contractor before going direct. This is important context: her Intel tenure is effectively 15+ years even though the titles shifted.

**Portland Raging Grannies:** Volunteer organization, civil rights and social justice focus. She manages their digital media and communications. This is not just resume filler; it reflects her values.

**Staffing agencies:** Aquent and Clover Search Works. She has established relationships here and uses them as one channel.

**Target companies/roles:** Senior content leadership roles broadly. Director of Content Strategy, Head of Content, Senior Communications Manager, UX Content Strategist. Recent applications included OrderlyMeds, Heartland Fund, and various contract roles.

## 6. Challenges and Friction Points

**Title/scope mismatch:** Maya's actual scope at Intel was Director-level but her title was Editorial Content Manager. This requires careful framing to avoid looking like she's overreaching when applying to Director roles.

**Application timing judgment calls:** Staleness of job postings (28+ days is a yellow flag), missing hard requirements (specific CMS platforms), and low-probability signals require constant triage. She's learned to be selective but this requires ongoing judgment calls.

**Geographic constraints:** Portland-based with a requirement for remote roles. This limits the pool.

**Effort allocation:** Deciding when to write a custom cover letter versus use an existing one versus skip entirely. The system she's built helps, but every posting still requires a decision.

**The contractor history framing:** Twelve years at Intel through CDI can read as "not a real Intel employee" if not framed correctly. She's developed language to address this but it requires consistent attention across all materials.

**Lingua Ink visibility:** Making sure the publishing work reads as serious business experience rather than a hobby or gap-filler, especially for enterprise roles that may not immediately see its relevance.

## 7. Decisions Made and Why

**Decision: Build a library of role-specific resumes rather than one master resume to customize each time.**
Alternatives considered: Customizing the master for every application. Reasoning: The time cost of customization is high and the ROI on minor tweaks is often low. Having pre-built versions for the main role categories means she can move fast on good opportunities and reserve deep customization energy for high-priority targets.

**Decision: No em dashes in any of her writing.**
This is a firm stylistic choice. No alternatives were debated; it's a hard rule. All documents and AI-generated content must honor this.

**Decision: Open cover letters with a "this is who I am" statement before naming the role.**
Alternative: Start with the role or company. Reasoning: Her career arc is genuinely unusual (developer to editorial strategist to publisher) and starting with a strong identity statement makes the rest of the letter cohere. It also demonstrates the narrative skills she's selling.

**Decision: Cover letters use flowing prose, no bullets or headers.**
Reasoning: The letters are themselves a demonstration of her communications skills. A bulleted cover letter undercuts the argument that she's an editorial leader.

**Decision: Multi-touchpoint application approach (LinkedIn + recruiter outreach + apply) rather than portal-only.**
Reasoning: Portal-only applications get lost. Building a relationship surface before or alongside the application improves chances of being seen.

**Decision: Start a new conversation per job application rather than continuing in the same thread.**
Reasoning: Maintains document formatting integrity when uploading materials. [INFERRED from memory context; not explicitly stated in this session]

## 8. Things You'd Tell the Next Claude

**Read the voice before you write anything.** The cover letters in this project are the canonical reference for her writing voice. Before drafting anything, internalize: confident without braggy, claim-then-evidence rhythm, clean quiet closers, no em dashes ever, prose not bullets.

**No em dashes. Seriously.** This will come up every single time and it's a hard rule. Check every draft before delivering it.

**Treat Lingua Ink as real.** Don't minimize it, don't frame it as a side project. It's a hybrid publishing company and marketing consulting operation she built and runs. The Lingua Ink Books imprint is specifically for underrepresented voices and matters to her personally.

**Her Intel title undersells her scope.** "Editorial Content Manager" was her title, but she was effectively running global content strategy and infrastructure for a Fortune 50 company's flagship newsroom. Frame accordingly when relevant.

**The CDI contractor history is not a liability, it's context.** Twelve years embedded at Intel through a contracting firm is still twelve years at Intel. The language she uses frames it as evolution ("evolved from project manager to lead technical developer"), and you should honor that framing.

**She knows what she wants.** Don't over-ask or over-explain. If the task is clear, do it. Ask one clarifying question if genuinely needed, not three.

**She has distinct voice contexts.** Lingua Ink voice is different from her professional job-search voice. LinkedIn is different from a cover letter. Pay attention to which context you're writing in.

**She is emotionally engaged with her work and wants you to be too.** When reviewing or discussing her writing, give specific, earned reactions. Generic praise ("great cover letter!") will fall flat.

**The application system is built; she mostly needs execution support.** She's not usually looking for strategic advice from scratch. She's usually looking for: analyze this posting, write this cover letter in my voice, tailor this resume section, help me decide if this is worth applying to.

**Preferred closers and sign-offs:** Cover letters end with "Best, Steph Bairey" or "Stephanie Bairey" depending on the name used in that version. She doesn't do elaborate sign-off paragraphs.
